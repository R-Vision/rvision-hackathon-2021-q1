By <ORG>GReAT</ORG>
For more than three years, the <ORG>Global Research and Analysis Team</ORG> (<ORG>GReAT</ORG>) at <ORG>Kaspersky</ORG>
has been publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity.
The summaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative
snapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT
reports. They are designed to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel
people should be aware of.
This is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q2 2020.
Readers who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more
information on a specific report are encouraged to contact ‘intelreports@kaspersky.com‘.
The most remarkable findings
On May 11, the <ORG>UK-based supercomputing center</ORG>, <ORG>ARCHER</ORG>, announced that it would
shut down access to its network while it investigated a security incident. The website
stated that the “<ORG>ARCHER</ORG> facility is based around a Cray XC30 supercomputer (with 4920
nodes) that provides the central computational resource”. At the same time, the German-
based bwHPC also announced a security incident and decided to restrict access to its
resources. <ORG>The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre</ORG>, at the time involved in a project to
study the small membrane protein of the coronavirus, confirmed that it, and other
European high-performance computer facilities, had been attacked and that it had
temporarily closed. On May 15, the <ORG>EGI Computer Security and Incident Response Team</ORG>
(<ORG>EGI-CSIRT</ORG>) published an alert covering two incidents that, according to its report, may
or may not be related. Both incidents describe the targeting of academic data centers for
“CPU mining purposes”. The alert includes a number of IoCs, which complement other
OSINT (open-source intelligence) observations. Although we weren’t able to establish
with a high degree of certitude that the <ORG>ARCHER</ORG> hack and the incidents described by
<ORG>EGI-CSIRT</ORG> are related, we suspect they might be. Some media speculated that all these
attacks might be related to COVID-19 research being carried out at the supercomputing
centers.
Interestingly, last July 16th 2020, <ORG>NCSC</ORG> published an advisory describing malicious
activity targeting institutions related to research to find a vaccine for COVID-19. In this
case, the malware used in the attacks belongs to a family called <MALWARE>WellMess</MALWARE>, as originally
described by <ORG>LAC Co</ORG> back in 2018. Until recently, this malware was not believed to be
related to any APT activity. Surprisingly, <ORG>NCSC</ORG> attributes this activity to the <THREAT_ACTOR>APT-29</THREAT_ACTOR>
threat actor. However, it does not provide any public proof.

7/31/2020 APT trends report Q2 2020 | Securelist
From our own research, we can confirm that <MALWARE>WellMess</MALWARE>’s activity seems to follow a cycle,
being used in campaigns every three months or so since its discovery. We observed a peak
of activity in fall of 2019, followed by an increase in the number of C2s in February 2020.
We also observed high-profile targeting, including <INDUSTRY>telcos</INDUSTRY>, <INDUSTRY>government</INDUSTRY> and <INDUSTRY>contractors</INDUSTRY> in
<GEO>MENA</GEO> and the <GEO>EU</GEO>. However, from our side we cannot confirm attribution or targeting of
health institutions at the moment.
For more details about <MALWARE>WellMess</MALWARE>, you can check our presentation from <ORG>GReAT</ORG> ideas

Russian-speaking activity
In May, researchers at <ORG>Leonardo</ORG> published a report about “<MALWARE>Penquin_x64</MALWARE>”, a previously
undocumented variant of <THREAT_ACTOR>Turla</THREAT_ACTOR>’s <MALWARE>Penquin</MALWARE> GNU/Linux backdoor. <ORG>Kaspersky</ORG> has publicly
documented the <MALWARE>Penquin</MALWARE> family, tracing it back to its Unix ancestors in the Moonlight
Maze operation of the 1990s. We followed up on this latest research by generating
network probes that detect <MALWARE>Penquin_x64</MALWARE> infected hosts at scale, allowing us to discover
that tens of internet hoster’s servers in <GEO>Europe</GEO> and the <GEO>US</GEO> are still compromised today.
We think it’s possible that, following public disclosure of <THREAT_ACTOR>Turla</THREAT_ACTOR>’s GNU/Linux tools, the
<THREAT_ACTOR>Turla</THREAT_ACTOR> threat actor may have been repurposing <MALWARE>Penquin</MALWARE> to conduct operations other than
traditional intelligence.
In June, we discovered two different domain names, “emro-who[.]in” and “emro-
who[.]org”, typo-squatting the <ORG>World Health Organization</ORG> (<ORG>WHO</ORG>) Regional Office for the
Eastern Mediterranean (<ORG>EMRO</ORG>). These domains, registered on June 21 using the
Njalla.no registrar, seem to be used as sender domains for a spear-phishing campaign.
This type of typo-squatting is reminiscent of <THREAT_ACTOR>Sofacy</THREAT_ACTOR> campaigns against other international
organizations. Moreover, we have seen Njalla.no recently used to register SPLM and
XTUNNEL C2 (command-and-control) servers and we have seen this autonomous system
used by <THREAT_ACTOR>Sofacy</THREAT_ACTOR> in the past for a SPLM C2.
<THREAT_ACTOR>Hades</THREAT_ACTOR> is an elusive, highly dynamic threat actor that commonly engages in tailored
hacking and special access operations, such as the <MALWARE>OlympicDestroyer</MALWARE> attack or the <MALWARE>ExPetr</MALWARE>
(aka <MALWARE>NotPetya</MALWARE>) and <MALWARE>Badrabbit</MALWARE> attacks. On May 28, the <ORG>US National Security Agency</ORG>
(<ORG>NSA</ORG>) published an alert detailing the use by <THREAT_ACTOR>Hades</THREAT_ACTOR> of an Exim vulnerability (CVE-2019-
10149) for what appears to be a potentially large hacking operation designed for mass
access. Our own report expanded on the scripts used in this operation, as well as
providing other IoCs that we discovered.
Chinese-speaking activity
In late 2019, and again in March this year, we described ongoing malicious activities from
a previously unknown threat actor that we named <THREAT_ACTOR>Holy Water</THREAT_ACTOR>. <THREAT_ACTOR>Holy Water</THREAT_ACTOR> notably
leveraged a Go language and Google Drive-command-driven implant that we dubbed
Godlike12. Following the publication of our report, and notifications to relevant incident
response organizations, new <THREAT_ACTOR>Holy Water</THREAT_ACTOR> samples were submitted to VirusTotal. The
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/ 2/8

7/31/2020 APT trends report Q2 2020 | Securelist
newly discovered samples include Telegram-controlled and open-source-based Python
implants that were probably deployed on the victim’s networks after a successful
intrusion.
In March, one of our YARA rules from previous research on <MALWARE>ShadowPad</MALWARE> attacks detected
a recently compiled executable file uploaded to VirusTotal. Later we found a few other
samples from our own telemetry. <MALWARE>ShadowPad</MALWARE> is a modular attack platform consisting of a
root module and various plugin modules responsible for diverse functionalities.
<MALWARE>ShadowPad</MALWARE> was first discovered by <ORG>Kaspersky</ORG> in 2017. In August of that year, one of our
customers detected suspicious network activities. After thorough investigation, we found
a legitimate software module that had been compromised and backdoored by an
advanced threat actor in a sophisticated software supply-chain attack. We notified the
software vendor and also published the outcome of our investigations in a technical white
paper. Since then, <MALWARE>ShadowPad</MALWARE> malware has been deployed in a number of major
cyberattacks, with a different subset of plugins used in different attack cases: the
<MALWARE>CCleaner</MALWARE> incident in 2017 and the <MALWARE>ShadowHammer</MALWARE> attacks in 2018 are the major
examples of such attacks.
When analyzing new samples from <MALWARE>ShadowPad</MALWARE> malware, compiled and used in attacks
since late 2019, our investigation revealed a strong connection between these recent
<MALWARE>ShadowPad</MALWARE> malware samples and the <THREAT_ACTOR>CactusPete</THREAT_ACTOR> threat actor. <THREAT_ACTOR>CactusPete</THREAT_ACTOR> started
deploying <MALWARE>ShadowPad</MALWARE> malware to a few victims at the beginning of 2019 through its
<MALWARE>HighProof</MALWARE> backdoor. However, since late 2019, <MALWARE>ShadowPad</MALWARE> has been commonly used in
<THREAT_ACTOR>CactusPete</THREAT_ACTOR> attacks.
This quarter, we described another <THREAT_ACTOR>CactusPete</THREAT_ACTOR> attack campaign which started in
December 2019 In this campaign, the <THREAT_ACTOR>CactusPete</THREAT_ACTOR> threat actor used a new method to drop
an updated version of the <MALWARE>DoubleT</MALWARE> backdoor onto the computers. The attackers
implanted a new dropper module in the Microsoft Word Startup directory, most likely
through a malicious document. This malicious dropper is responsible for dropping and
executing a new version of the <MALWARE>DoubleT</MALWARE> backdoor, which utilizes a new method of
encrypting the C2 server address.
While analysing compromised machines in <GEO>Central Asia</GEO>, we revealed an additional
infection that was unrelated to the initial subject of our investigation. This led us to detect
previously unknown malware that we dubbed B&W, which provides an attacker with the
capabilities to remotely control a victim’s machine. Further analysis of the samples,
infrastructure and other related artefacts allowed us to conclude, with medium
confidence, that the newly found malware is related to the <THREAT_ACTOR>SixLittleMonkeys</THREAT_ACTOR> APT. This
group is known to have been active for several years, targeting government entities in
<GEO>Central Asia</GEO>.
<THREAT_ACTOR>HoneyMyte</THREAT_ACTOR> is an APT threat actor that we have been tracking for several years. In
February, our fellow researchers at Avira blogged about <THREAT_ACTOR>HoneyMyte</THREAT_ACTOR> <MALWARE>PlugX</MALWARE> variants that
they had recently observed targeting <GEO>Hong Kong</GEO>. <MALWARE>PlugX</MALWARE> has been used by multiple APT
groups over the past decade, especially shared among Chinese-speaking threat actors, and
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/ 3/8

7/31/2020 <THREAT_ACTOR>AP</THREAT_ACTOR>T trends report Q2 2020 | Securelist
has changed in many ways. Avira´s post covers the <MALWARE>PlugX</MALWARE> loader and backdoor payload,
including its USB capabilities. In May, we published an update on this threat actor,
specifically providing timely indicators to aid in threat hunting for some of the PlugX
variants found in the wild between January and May this year.
In May, we discovered a watering hole on the website of a Southeast Asian top official.
This watering hole, set up in March, seemed to leverage whitelisting and social
engineering techniques to infect its targets. The final payload was a simple ZIP archive
containing a readme file prompting the victim to execute a <MALWARE>CobaltStrike</MALWARE> implant. The
mechanism used to execute <MALWARE>CobaltStrike</MALWARE> was DLL side-loading, which decrypted and
executed a <MALWARE>CobaltStrike</MALWARE> stager shellcode. Analysis of the code, the infrastructure and the
victimology led us to attribute this watering-hole, with high confidence, to the <THREAT_ACTOR>HoneyMyte</THREAT_ACTOR>
APT threat actor.
<MALWARE>Quarian</MALWARE> is a little-known malicious program that Chinese-speaking actors have used since
around 2012. We hadn’t spotted any further activity until we observed a resurgence in an
attack by the <THREAT_ACTOR>Icefog</THREAT_ACTOR> group in 2019. We tracked the activity of the malware following this
and noticed a new variant that was used during several attacks on <ORG>Middle Eastern and
African governments</ORG> during 2020. In one case, we could see that this variant was
deployed following exploitation of the CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability on the network of a
government entity. This vulnerability, which was publicly reported in February 2020,
allows an authenticated user to run commands as SYSTEM on a Microsoft Exchange
server. In this case, the server was indeed compromised and was hosting the
<MALWARE>ChinaChopper</MALWARE> webshell, which was used to obtain, and later launch, the <MALWARE>Quarian</MALWARE> and
<MALWARE>PlugX</MALWARE> backdoors. Our analysis led us to assume, with medium to high confidence, that
the group behind these attacks is one we track under the name <THREAT_ACTOR>CloudComputating</THREAT_ACTOR> – a
Chinese-speaking actor that, based on previous reports, has targeted high-profile Middle
Eastern diplomatic targets.
In March, researchers at <ORG>Check Point</ORG> Research published a report describing an APT
campaign that targeted <GEO>Mongolia</GEO>’s public sector and leveraged a coronavirus-themed lure
to conduct its initial intrusion. We were able to discover further samples and another
COVID-themed document with the same targeting, as well as additional targets in <GEO>Russia</GEO>.
We attribute this activity with medium confidence to <THREAT_ACTOR>IronHusky</THREAT_ACTOR>.
<GEO>Middle East</GEO>
The <THREAT_ACTOR>MuddyWater</THREAT_ACTOR> APT was discovered in 2017 and has been active in the <GEO>Middle East</GEO> ever
since. In 2019, we reported activity against telecoms providers in <GEO>Iraq</GEO> and <GEO>Iran</GEO>, as well as
government bodies in <GEO>Lebanon</GEO>. We recently discovered <MALWARE>MuddyWater</MALWARE> using a new C++
toolchain in a new wave of attacks in which the actor leveraged an open-source utility
called Secure Socket Funneling for lateral movement.
At the end of May, we observed that <THREAT_ACTOR>Oilrig</THREAT_ACTOR> had included the DNSExfitrator tool in its
toolset. It allows the threat actor to use the DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol. Use of the
DNS protocol for malware communications is a technique that <THREAT_ACTOR>Oilrig</THREAT_ACTOR> has been using for a
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/ 4/8

7/31/2020 APT trends report Q2 2020 | Securelist
long time. The difference between DNS- and DoH-based requests is that, instead of plain
text requests to port 53, they would use port 443 in encrypted packets. <THREAT_ACTOR>Oilrig</THREAT_ACTOR> added the
publicly available DNSExfiltrator tool to its arsenal, which allows <ORG>DoH</ORG> queries to <ORG>Google</ORG>
and Cloudflare services. This time, the operators decided to use subdomains of a COVID-
related domain which are hardcoded in the DNSExfitrator detected samples.
<GEO>Southеast Asia</GEO> and <GEO>Korean Peninsula</GEO>
<THREAT_ACTOR>BlueNoroff</THREAT_ACTOR> is one of the most prolific financially motivated APT actors and we have
published several reports of <THREAT_ACTOR>BlueNoroff</THREAT_ACTOR> campaigns targeting financial institutions.
Recently, we uncovered another campaign that has been active since at least 2017. In this
campaign, the group sends spear-phishing emails containing an archived Windows
shortcut file. The file names are disguised as security or cryptocurrency related files in
order to entice users into executing them. The infection chain started from this shortcut
file is a complex multi-stage infection procedure. Before delivering the Windows
executable payload, the actor uses two VBS and three PowerShell scripts in order to
collect system information. The actor very carefully delivers the final payload only to the
intended targets. The backdoor payload also utilizes a multi-stage infection procedure.
The actor uses it to control infected hosts and implants additional malware for
surveillance. These malicious programs are responsible for stealing the user’s keystrokes
and saving a screenshot of the infected machine. The main targets of this campaign are
financial institutions, such as cryptocurrency businesses, and fintech companies. We
identified diverse victims from 10 countries, as well as more potential victims from open
source intelligence.
The <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> group has been a major threat actor for several years. Alongside goals like
cyber-espionage and cyber-sabotage, this threat actor has targeted <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY> and other
<INDUSTRY>financial</INDUSTRY> companies around the globe. The group continues to be very active. We recently
observed the <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> group attacking a software vendor in <GEO>South Korea</GEO> using <MALWARE>Bookcode</MALWARE>,
malware that we evaluate to be a <MALWARE>Manuscrypt</MALWARE> variant, utilizing a watering-hole attack to
deliver it. <MALWARE>Manus</MALWARE>crypt is one of the <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> group’s tools that is actively being updated
and used. The group attacked the same victim twice. Almost a year prior to compromising
this victim, <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> attempted to infect it by masquerading as a well-known security tool,
but failed. We were able to construct the group’s post-exploitation activity, identifying
various freeware and red-teaming tools used. Although <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> has recently tended to
focus more on targeting the <INDUSTRY>financial</INDUSTRY> industry, we believe that in this campaign they were
seeking to exfiltrate intellectual property. We also observed that they previously spread
<MALWARE>Bookcode</MALWARE> using a decoy document related to a company working in the defense sector.
Based on our observations, we evaluate that the <MALWARE>Bookcode</MALWARE> malware is being used
exclusively for cyber-espionage campaigns.
In April, we released an early warning about the <MALWARE>VHD</MALWARE> ransomware, which was first
spotted in late March. This ransomware stood out because of its self-replication method.
The use of a spreading utility compiled with victim-specific credentials was reminiscent of
APT campaigns, but at the time we were unable to link the attack to an existing group.
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/ 5/8

7/31/2020 APT trends report Q2 2020 | Securelist
However, <ORG>Kaspersky</ORG> was able to identify an incident in which the <MALWARE>VHD</MALWARE> ransomware was
deployed, in close conjunction with known <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> tools, against businesses in <GEO>France</GEO>
and <GEO>Asia</GEO>. This indicates that <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> is behind the <MALWARE>VHD</MALWARE> ransomware campaigns that have
been documented so far. As far as we know, this is also the first time it has been
established that the <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> group has resorted to targeted ransomware attacks for
financial gain.
Last year we created a private report on a malware framework that we named <MALWARE>MATA</MALWARE>,
which we attribute, with low confidence, to the <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> group. This framework included
several components, such as a loader, orchestrator and plug-ins. Initially, this framework
targeted Windows and Linux. However, in April we discovered a suspicious macOS file
uploaded to VirusTotal using a rule to detect the <MALWARE>MATA</MALWARE> malware framework. After
looking into this malware, we confirmed that it was a macOS variant of the <MALWARE>MATA</MALWARE>
malware. The malware developers Trojanized an open-source two-factor authentication
application and utilized another open-source application template. While investigating, to
find more solid evidence for attribution, we found an old <MALWARE>Manuscrypt</MALWARE> strain that used a
similar configuration structure. We also discovered a cluster of C2 servers probably
related to this campaign.
The <MALWARE>MATA</MALWARE> framework was not the only way that <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> targeted macOS. We also
observed a cluster of activity linked to Operation <MALWARE>AppleJeus</MALWARE>. The other was similar to the
macOS malware used in a campaign that we call <MALWARE>TangDaiwbo</MALWARE>. This is a multi-platform
cryptocurrency exchange campaign: <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> utilizes macro-embedded Office documents
and spreads PowerShell or macOS malware, depending on the victim’s system.
Early this year, we reported improvements in a <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> campaign targeting a
cryptocurrency business. In this campaign, <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> adopted a downloader that sends
compromised host information and selectively fetches the next-stage payload. Recently,
we identified a <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> campaign with similar strategies, but targeting academic and
automotive sectors. <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> also adopted new methods to deliver its tools. First of all, the
group elaborated its weaponized document by adopting remote template injection
techniques. Previously, <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> delivered macro-embedded documents to the victim, but
the group has now applied one more stage to hinder detection. The group also utilized an
open-source PDF reader named Sumatra PDF to make Trojanized applications. They
created a Trojanized PDF reader, sending it to the victim with a crafted PDF file. If the
victim opens this file, the Trojanised PDF viewer implants malicious files and shows
decoy documents to deceive the victim. The actor delivers the final payload very carefully,
and executes it in memory. Fortunately, we were able to get the final payload and confirm
that it was a <MALWARE>Manuscrypt</MALWARE> variant that we had already described. We also found that it’s
the same malware variant that the <ORG>US CISA</ORG> (<ORG>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency</ORG>) recently reported, named <MALWARE>COPPERHEDGE</MALWARE>.
Following our report describing the long-standing <MALWARE>PhantomLance</MALWARE> campaign in <GEO>Southeast
Asia</GEO>, we published a private report providing detailed attribution based on discovered
overlaps with reported campaigns of the <THREAT_ACTOR>OceanLotus</THREAT_ACTOR> APT. In particular, we found
multiple code similarities with the previous Android campaign, as well as similarities in
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/ 6/8

7/31/2020 APT trends report Q2 2020 | Securelist
macOS backdoors, infrastructure overlap with Windows backdoors and a couple of cross-
platform resemblances. Based on our research, we believe, with medium confidence, that
<MALWARE>PhantomLance</MALWARE> is a modern Android campaign conducted by <THREAT_ACTOR>OceanLotus</THREAT_ACTOR>. Apart from the
attribution details, we described the actor’s spreading strategy using techniques to bypass
app market filters. We also provided additional details about samples associated with
previously reported suspected infrastructure, as well as the latest sample deployed in
2020 that uses Firebase to decrypt its payload.
Additionally, <THREAT_ACTOR>OceanLotus</THREAT_ACTOR> has been using new variants of its multi-stage loader since the
second half of 2019. The new variants use target-specific information (username,
hostname, etc.) of the targeted host that they obtained beforehand, in order to ensure
their final implant is deployed on the right victim. The group continues to deploy its
backdoor implant, as well as <MALWARE>Cobalt Strike</MALWARE> <MALWARE>Beacon</MALWARE>, configuring them with updated
infrastructure.
Other interesting discoveries
The <THREAT_ACTOR>Deceptikons</THREAT_ACTOR> APT is a long-running espionage group believed to have been providing
mercenary services for almost a decade now. The group is not technically sophisticated
and has not, to our knowledge, deployed zero-day exploits. The <THREAT_ACTOR>Deceptikons</THREAT_ACTOR>
infrastructure and malware set is clever, rather than technically advanced. It is also highly
persistent and in many ways reminds us of <MALWARE>WildNeutron</MALWARE>. <THREAT_ACTOR>Deceptikon</THREAT_ACTOR>’s repeated targeting
of commercial and non-governmental organizations is somewhat unusual for APT actors.
In 2019, <THREAT_ACTOR>Deceptikons</THREAT_ACTOR> spear-phished a set of European law firms, deploying PowerShell
scripts. As in previous campaigns, the actor used modified LNK files requiring user
interaction to initially compromise systems and execute a PowerShell backdoor. In all
likelihood, the group’s motivations included obtaining specific financial information,
details of negotiations, and perhaps even evidence of the law firms’ clientele.
<MALWARE>MagicScroll</MALWARE> (aka <MALWARE>AcidBox</MALWARE>) is the name we’ve given to a sophisticated malware framework,
whose main purpose is to decrypt and load an arbitrary payload in kernel mode. The
framework consists of several stages. The first stage is a Windows security provider that is
loaded by the system on boot and executed in user mode. This decrypts and runs a second
payload, which is physically stored in the registry. Although we weren’t able to find a
victim with this second stage, we were able to find a file that matches the expected format
of the second stage. This second stage payload utilizes a well-known vulnerability in a
VirtualBox driver (CVE-2008-3431) to load the third stage, which is designed to run in
kernel mode. The kernel mode payload is decrypted from a resource from the second
stage, using the key retrieved from the registry. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find a
decryption key to decrypt the third stage payload, so we don’t know what the last part of
this malware framework looks like. Although the code is quite sophisticated, we couldn’t
identify any similarity with other known frameworks.
Aarogya Setu is the name of a mandatory COVID-19 mobile tracking app developed by the
<ORG>National Informatics Centre</ORG>, an organization that comes under the <ORG>Ministry of
Electronics and Information Technology</ORG> in <GEO>India</GEO>. It allows its users to connect to
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/ 7/8

7/31/2020 APT trends report Q2 2020 | Securelist
essential health services in India. With cyber criminals and APT actors taking advantage
of pandemic-tracking applications to distribute Trojanized mobile apps, we investigated
and identified apps that mimic the appearance and behavior of the legitimate Aarogya
Setu app while deploying Android RATs. We consider one of these to be a new version of
a RAT that we previously reported being used by the <THREAT_ACTOR>Transparent Tribe</THREAT_ACTOR> threat actor.
Final thoughts
The threat landscape isn’t always full of “groundbreaking” events. However, a review of
the activities of APT threat actors indicates that there are always interesting
developments. Our regular quarterly reviews are intended to highlight these key
developments.
Here are the main trends that we’ve seen in Q2 2020.
Geo-politics remains an important motive for some APT threat actors, as shown in
the activities of <THREAT_ACTOR>MuddyWater</THREAT_ACTOR>, the compromise of the <GEO>Middle East</GEO> Eye website and
the campaigns of <THREAT_ACTOR>CloudComputating</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>HoneyMyte</THREAT_ACTOR> groups.
As is clear from the activities of <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>BlueNoroff</THREAT_ACTOR>, financial gain is another
driver for some threat actors – including the use of ransomware attacks.
While Southeast Asia continues to be an active region for APT activities, this quarter
we have also observed heavy activity by Chinese-speaking groups, including
<THREAT_ACTOR>ShadowPad</THREAT_ACTOR>, <THREAT_ACTOR>HoneyMyte</THREAT_ACTOR>, <THREAT_ACTOR>CactusPete</THREAT_ACTOR>, <THREAT_ACTOR>CloudComputating</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>SixLittleMonkeys</THREAT_ACTOR>.
APT threat actors continue to exploit software vulnerabilities – examples this
quarter include <THREAT_ACTOR>Hades</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>MagicScroll</THREAT_ACTOR>.
We have noted before that the use of mobile implants is no longer a novelty, and
this quarter is no exception, as illustrated by the <THREAT_ACTOR>PhantomLance</THREAT_ACTOR> campaign.
It is clear that APT actors, like opportunistic cybercriminals, continue to exploit the
COVID-19 pandemic as a theme to lure potential victims. However, we would note
once again that this doesn’t represent a shift in TTPs.
As always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat
landscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually
improve, there is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our
radar.
