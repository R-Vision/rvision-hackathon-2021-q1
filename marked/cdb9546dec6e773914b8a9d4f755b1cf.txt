By <ORG>GReAT</ORG>
For just under two years, the <ORG>Global Research and Analysis Team</ORG> (<ORG>GReAT</ORG>) at
<ORG>Kaspersky Lab</ORG> has been publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat
(APT) activity. The summaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide
a representative snapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in
our private APT reports. They aim to highlight the signiﬁcant events and ﬁndings that we
feel people should be aware of.
This is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q1 2019.
Readers who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more
information on a speciﬁc report are encouraged to contact ‘intelreports@kaspersky.com’.
The most remarkable ﬁnding
Targeting supply-chains has proved very successful for attackers in recent years –
<MALWARE>ShadowPad</MALWARE>, <MALWARE>CCleaner</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>ExPetr</MALWARE> are good examples. In our threat predictions for
2019, we ﬂagged this as a likely continuing attack vector; and we didn’t have to wait very
long to see this prediction come true. In January, we discovered a sophisticated supply-
chain attack involving the ASUS Live Update Utility, the mechanism used to deliver
BIOS, UEFI and software updates to ASUS laptops and desktops. The attackers behind
“<THREAT_ACTOR>Operation ShadowHammer</THREAT_ACTOR>” added a backdoor to the utility and then distributed it to
users through ofﬁcial channels. The goal of the attack was to target with precision an
unknown pool of users, identiﬁed by their network adapter MAC addresses. The
attackers were found to have hardcoded a list of MAC addresses into the Trojanized
samples, representing the true targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract
over 600 unique MAC addresses from more than 200 samples discovered in this attack,
although it’s possible that other samples exist that target different MAC addresses.
Russian-speaking activity
Russian-speaking groups were not especially active during the ﬁrst part of the year, with
no noteworthy technical or operational changes. However, they continued their non-stop
activity in terms of spreading, with a special interest in political activity.
This was apparent in an attack focused on the <GEO>Ukraine</GEO> elections. The attack surfaced
after we discovered a malicious Word document targeting a German political advisory
organization. This organization, according to its website, “advises political decision-
makers on international politics and foreign and security policy”. Our technical analysis of
the attack suggests that the <THREAT_ACTOR>Sofacy</THREAT_ACTOR> or <THREAT_ACTOR>Hades</THREAT_ACTOR> groups are behind it, though we’re unable
to say for sure which of these groups is responsible.

Such political interests are not new. Recently, a court in <GEO>Virginia</GEO> gave <ORG>Microsoft</ORG> control of
a group of websites that were intended to look like login sites for a <GEO>Washington</GEO> think
tank, but are believed to be part of the infrastructure of a “Russian group suspected in
the DNC hack”.
Additionally, <ORG>Microsoft</ORG> revealed that a “Russian nation-state hacking group” targeted
political organizations engaged in the 2019 European Parliament elections scheduled for
the end of May.
On the technical side, since mid-January we have been tracking an active <THREAT_ACTOR>Turla</THREAT_ACTOR>
campaign targeting government bodies in <GEO>Turkmenistan</GEO> and <GEO>Tajikistan</GEO>. This time the
actor delivered its known <MALWARE>KopiLuwak</MALWARE> JavaScript using new .NET malware, called
“<MALWARE>Topinambour</MALWARE>” (aka <MALWARE>Sunchoke</MALWARE>) by its developers. The <MALWARE>Topinambour</MALWARE> dropper is delivered
along with legitimate software and consists of a tiny .NET shell that waits for Windows
shell commands from operators. Interestingly, in this campaign the attackers used
different artefacts implemented in JavaScript, .NET and PowerShell – all of them with
similar functionality.
We also published details on how <MALWARE>Zebrocy</MALWARE> has added the “Go” language to its arsenal –
the ﬁrst time that we have observed a well-known APT threat actor deploy malware with
this compiled, open source language. <MALWARE>Zebrocy</MALWARE> continues to target government-related
organizations in <GEO>Central Asia</GEO>, both in-country and in remote locations, as well as a new
diplomatic target in the <GEO>Middle East</GEO>.
Finally, during February 2019 we observed a highly targeted attack in <GEO>Crimea</GEO> using a
previously unknown malware. The spy program was spread by email and masqueraded
as the VPN-client of a well-known Russian security company that, among other things,
provides solutions to protect networks. At this point we can’t relate this activity to any
known actor.
Chinese-speaking activity
Recent APT trend summaries included analyses of new Chinese-speaking threat actors
as well as the resurgence of old activity sets. This has continued into 2019.
In the early months of 2019, Chinese-speaking actors were the most active, with a
traditional interest in targeting different countries in <GEO>South East Asia</GEO>. A recent indictment
of two Chinese nationals by the <ORG>US Department of Justice</ORG> on charges of computer
hacking, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, alleged that they
were members of the <THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR> group, carrying out illegal activity on behalf of the <ORG>Chinese
Ministry of State Security</ORG>.
Similarly, <THREAT_ACTOR>CactusPete</THREAT_ACTOR> (aka <THREAT_ACTOR>LoneRanger</THREAT_ACTOR>, <THREAT_ACTOR>Karma Panda</THREAT_ACTOR>, and <THREAT_ACTOR>Tonto Team</THREAT_ACTOR>), is reported to
have targeted South Korean, Japanese, US, and Taiwanese organizations in the 2012 –
2014 timeframe. The actor has quite likely relied on much the same codebase and
implant variants for the past six years. However these have broadened substantially
since 2018. The group spear-phishes its targets, deploys Word and <MALWARE>Equation</MALWARE> Editor
exploits and an appropriated/repackaged <THREAT_ACTOR>DarkHotel</THREAT_ACTOR> VBScript zero-day, delivers modiﬁed
and compiled unique <MALWARE>Mimikatz</MALWARE> variants, GSEC and WCE credential stealers, a

keylogger, various Escalation of Privilege exploits, various older utilities and an updated
set of backdoors, and what appear to be new variants of custom downloader and
backdoor modules.
We have been monitoring a campaign targeting <ORG>Vietnamese government</ORG> and diplomatic
entities abroad since at least April 2018. We attribute the campaign, which we call
“<CAMPAIGN>SpoiledLegacy</CAMPAIGN>”, to the <THREAT_ACTOR>LuckyMouse</THREAT_ACTOR> <THREAT_ACTOR>APT group</THREAT_ACTOR> (aka <THREAT_ACTOR>EmissaryPanda</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>APT27</THREAT_ACTOR>). The
operators use penetration testing frameworks such as <MALWARE>Cobalt Strike</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>Metasploit</MALWARE>.
While we believe that they exploit network services vulnerabilities as their main initial
infection vector, we have also seen spear-phishing messages containing decoy
documents. We believe that, as in a previous <THREAT_ACTOR>LuckyMouse</THREAT_ACTOR> campaign internal database
servers are among the targets. For the last stage of their attack they use different in-
memory 32- and 64-bit Trojans injected into system process memory. It is worth
highlighting that all the tools in the infection chain dynamically obfuscate Win32 API calls
using leaked HackingTeam code.
<ORG>FireEye</ORG> deﬁned <THREAT_ACTOR>APT40</THREAT_ACTOR> as the Chinese state-sponsored threat actor previously reported
as <MALWARE>TEMP.Periscope</MALWARE>, <THREAT_ACTOR>Leviathan</THREAT_ACTOR> and <MALWARE>TEMP.Jumper</MALWARE>. According to <ORG>FireEye</ORG>, the group has
conducted operations in support of China’s naval modernisation effort since at least
2013, speciﬁcally targeting <INDUSTRY>engineering</INDUSTRY>, <INDUSTRY>transportation</INDUSTRY> and <INDUSTRY>defence</INDUSTRY> industries, especially
where these sectors overlap with <INDUSTRY>maritime technologies</INDUSTRY>. Recently, <ORG>FireEye</ORG> also
observed speciﬁc targeting of countries strategically important to the “Belt and Road”
Initiative, including <GEO>Cambodia</GEO>, <GEO>Belgium</GEO>, <GEO>Germany</GEO>, <GEO>Hong Kong</GEO>, the <GEO>Philippines</GEO>, <GEO>Malaysia</GEO>,
<GEO>Norway</GEO>, <GEO>Saudi Arabia</GEO>, <GEO>Switzerland</GEO>, the <GEO>United States</GEO> and the <GEO>United Kingdom</GEO>.
Interestingly, the use of newer <MALWARE>ANEL</MALWARE> versions by <THREAT_ACTOR>APT10</THREAT_ACTOR>, targeting <GEO>Japan</GEO>, allowed us to
ﬁnd similarities between this malware and <MALWARE>Emdivi</MALWARE>, malware previously used by
<THREAT_ACTOR>BlueTermite</THREAT_ACTOR>. This suggests a potential connection between both actors.
<GEO>South East Asia</GEO> and <GEO>Korean peninsula</GEO>
Once again, this seems to be the most active region of the world in terms of APT activity.
In January, we identiﬁed new activity by the <THREAT_ACTOR>Transparent Tribe APT group</THREAT_ACTOR> (aka
<THREAT_ACTOR>PROJECTM</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>MYTHIC LEOPARD</THREAT_ACTOR>), a threat actor with interests aligned with <GEO>Pakistan</GEO>
that has shown a persistent focus on Indian military targets.
In February, we identiﬁed a campaign targeting military organizations, this time in <GEO>India</GEO>.
We are currently unable to attribute this campaign to any known threat actor. The
attackers rely on watering-holes and spear-phishing to infect their victims. Speciﬁcally,
they were able to compromise a website belonging to a think tank related to warfare
studies, using it to host a malicious document that distributed a variant of the <MALWARE>Netwire</MALWARE>
<MALWARE>RAT</MALWARE>. We also found evidence of a compromised welfare club for military personnel
distributing the same malware during the same time period.
<THREAT_ACTOR>OceanLotus</THREAT_ACTOR> was another actor active during this period, using a new downloader called
<MALWARE>KerrDown</MALWARE>, as reported by <ORG>Palo Alto</ORG>. The actor was discovered at the beginning of the
year using freshly-compiled samples in a new wave of attacks. <ORG>ESET</ORG> recently uncovered
a new addition to this actor’s toolset targeting Mac OS.

In mid-2018, our report on “Operation <MALWARE>AppleJeus</MALWARE>” highlighted the focus of the <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR>
threat actor on cryptocurrency exchanges. In this operation, the group used a fake
company with a backdoored product aimed at cryptocurrency businesses. One of the
key ﬁndings was the group’s new ability to target Mac OS. Since then, <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> has
expanded its operations for this platform. Further tracking of the group’s activities has
enabled us to discover a new operation, active since at least November 2018, which
utilizes PowerShell to control Windows systems and Mac OS malware to target <ORG>Apple</ORG>
customers. <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> isn’t the only APT group targeting cryptocurrency exchanges. The
<MALWARE>Kimsuky</MALWARE> group has also extended its activities to include individuals and companies in
this sector, mainly in South Korea.
Finally, at the start of the year, the South Asian <THREAT_ACTOR>Bitter</THREAT_ACTOR> group used a new simple
downloader (called <MALWARE>ArtraDownloader</MALWARE> by <ORG>Palo Alto</ORG>) that delivers the <MALWARE>BitterRat Trojan</MALWARE> to
target organizations in <GEO>Saudi Arabia</GEO> and <GEO>Pakistan</GEO>.
<GEO>Middle East</GEO>
Surprisingly, during the ﬁrst months of the year activity in the <GEO>Middle East</GEO> has,
apparently, been less intense than in the past. Even so, it was the target of several
groups already discussed, such as <THREAT_ACTOR>Chafer</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>Bitter</THREAT_ACTOR>.
We also observed some activity from <THREAT_ACTOR>Gaza Team</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>MuddyWater</THREAT_ACTOR>. Still, this can be
considered part of their continued targeting of the region, showing nothing new in terms
of operational or technical improvements.
Other interesting discoveries
Late in 2018 we observed a new version of the <MALWARE>FinSpy</MALWARE> iOS implant in the wild. This is
part of <MALWARE>FinSpy</MALWARE> Mobile, a product provided by the surveillance solutions developer,
<ORG>Gamma Group</ORG>. <MALWARE>FinSpy</MALWARE> for iOS implements extensive spyware features that allow
someone to track almost everything on infected devices, including keypresses,
messages and calls. A big limitation is that the current version can only be installed on
jailbroken devices. We believe that <ORG>Gamma Group</ORG> does not provide an exploit tool to
jailbreak victims’ phones, but it provides advice and support to customers on how to do
the jailbreaking themselves. Our telemetry shows implant traces in <GEO>Indonesia</GEO> and
<GEO>Mongolia</GEO>. However, due to the large number of <THREAT_ACTOR>Gamma</THREAT_ACTOR> customers, this is probably only
a fraction of the victims.
Following this research, we discovered a new version for Android also dated circa June
2018. While it is quite similar in terms of functionality, it implements unique capabilities
speciﬁc to the platform such as obtaining root privileges by abusing the <MALWARE>DirtyCow</MALWARE> exploit
(CVE-2016-5195). Just like the iOS version, this implant has features to exﬁltrate data
from Instant Messengers including Threema, Signal, Whatsapp and Telegram, as well as
internal device information including, but not limited to, emails and SMS messages.
In February, our AEP (Automatic Exploit Prevention) systems detected an attempt to
exploit a vulnerability in Windows – the fourth consecutive exploited Local Privilege
Escalation vulnerability in Windows that we have recently discovered using our
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2019/90643/ 4/6

5/13/2019 APT trends report Q1 2019 | Securelist
technologies. Further analysis led us to uncover a zero-day vulnerability in “win32k.sys”.
We reported this to <ORG>Microsoft</ORG> on 22 February. The company conﬁrmed the vulnerability
and assigned it CVE-2019-0797. <ORG>Microsoft</ORG> released a patch on 12 March 2019, crediting
<ORG>Kaspersky Lab</ORG> researchers <IDENTITY>Vasiliy Berdnikov</IDENTITY> and <IDENTITY>Boris</IDENTITY> <IDENTITY>Larin</IDENTITY> with the discovery. We
believe that this exploit is being used by several threat actors – including, but possibly
not limited to, <THREAT_ACTOR>FruityArmor</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>SandCat</THREAT_ACTOR>. <THREAT_ACTOR>FruityArmor</THREAT_ACTOR> is known to have used zero-days
before, while <THREAT_ACTOR>SandCat</THREAT_ACTOR> is a new APT actor that we discovered only recently. The exploit
found in the wild was targeting 64-bit operating systems in the Windows 8 to Windows
10 build 15063 range.
<THREAT_ACTOR>FrutiyArmor</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>SandCat</THREAT_ACTOR>, interestingly, seem to follow parallel paths, both having the
same exploits available at the same time. This seems to point to a third party providing
both with such artefacts.
Ransomware has become an interesting tool for APT actors, as it can be used to delete
traces, conduct cyber-sabotage, or as a powerful distraction. There is an interesting
wave of ransomware attacks that we have been following, as they seem to be mainly
interested in big targets. <MALWARE>LockerGoga</MALWARE> recently compromised the systems of <ORG>Altran</ORG>, <ORG>Norsk
Hydro</ORG> and other companies. It’s unclear who’s behind the attacks, what they want and
the mechanism used to ﬁrst infect its victims. It’s not even clear if <MALWARE>LockerGoga</MALWARE> is
ransomware or a wiper. The malware encrypts data and displays a ransom asking
victims to get in touch to arrange decryption, in return for an (unspeciﬁed) payment in
bitcoins. However, later versions were observed by researchers that forcibly log victims
off infected systems by changing their passwords and removing their ability to log back
into the system. In such cases, the victims may not even get to see the ransom note.
Final thoughts
Looking back at what has happened during the ﬁrst months of the year is always a
surprising experience for us. Even when we have the feeling that “nothing
groundbreaking” has occurred, we always uncover a threat landscape that is full of many
interesting stories and evolution on different fronts.
If we are to provide a few general highlights, we can conclude that:
Geopolitics keeps gaining weight as the main driver of APT activity
<GEO>South East Asia</GEO> is still the most active region of the world in terms of APT activity,
but probably this is also related to the “noise” that some of the less experienced
groups make
Russian-speaking groups keep a low proﬁle in comparison with recent years:
maybe this is part of internal restructuring, but this is just a hypothesis
Chinese-speaking actors maintain a high level of activity, combining low and high
sophistication depending on the campaign
Providers of “commercial” malware available for governments and other entities
seem to be doing well, with more customers
If we are to highlight one thing from the whole period, in our opinion operation
<THREAT_ACTOR>ShadowHammer</THREAT_ACTOR> combines several factors that deﬁne the current status of APT activity.
This is an advanced and targeted campaign using the supply-chain for distribution on an
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2019/90643/ 5/6

5/13/2019 APT trends report Q1 2019 | Securelist
incredibly wide scale. It involves several steps in a combined operation, including the
initial collection of MAC addresses for their targets. This seems to be a new trend, as the
actor also targeted other victims for malware distribution, showing how worrisome and
difﬁcult it is to ﬁght supply-chain attacks.
As always, this is only our visibility. We always have to keep in mind other sophisticated
attacks that happen under our radar, but we continue to try and improve, to uncover
every single one of them.
