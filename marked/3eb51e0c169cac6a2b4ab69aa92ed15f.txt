In light of rising cyberattacks and ahead of the 2021 <GEO>Tokyo</GEO> Games, Japan is investing in
cybersecurity efforts, with one of them being the establishment of a government entity
dubbed the Digital Agency. The decision follows recent fraud involving Japanese <INDUSTRY>bank</INDUSTRY>
accounts linked to cashless payments services, which could be achieved by brute-
forcing, using compromised credentials to banking accounts or via other attack vectors.
Attacks on the banking infrastructure is just a part of threats targeting Japanese
organizations, recently explored by <ORG>KELA</ORG>. They include:
Leaked data and compromised accounts. <ORG>KELA</ORG> detected that data
belonging to Japanese corporations, as well as government and educational
entities, is actively circulating in the darknet and being demanded by threat
actors. This data can be used to gain initial network accesses, i.e. entry points to
targeted networks.
Initial network accesses. <ORG>KELA</ORG> observed several Japanese compromised
companies, ranging from corporations to universities, including one <ORG>Japan
ministry</ORG> target during June-October 2020. These accesses can be leveraged to
eventually deploy ransomware.
Ransomware incidents. <ORG>KELA</ORG> detected at least 11 Japanese victims of
ransomware attacks in June-October 2020. The affected companies are from
<INDUSTRY>manufacturing</INDUSTRY>, <INDUSTRY>construction</INDUSTRY> and <INDUSTRY>government</INDUSTRY>-related industries, with top victims
having around $143 billion, $33 billion and $2 billion yearly revenue.

Leaked Data and Compromised Accounts: Demand for Japanese
Companies
Among the most prominent threats on the darknet, <ORG>KELA</ORG> observed leaks and sales of
Japanese entities’ data. While many offers are related to regular users, some
actors are specifically looking for corporate data of Japanese
organizations.

Exposed data may include personal information of companies’ customers and
employees, sensitive internal documents, and credentials to the company’s resources.
For example, the <THREAT_ACTOR>KelvinSecurityTeam</THREAT_ACTOR> hacking group has been trading a database of a
major <GEO>Japan</GEO> corporation since July 2020. It has been recently promoted again as a part
of their offers.
The threat actor claimed that the database contains records of 150,000 customers,
possibly Japanese ones. As <ORG>KELA</ORG> observed from samples of the database, the records
include names, addresses, birth dates, emails, and phone numbers, as well as some data
related to their work history. <THREAT_ACTOR>KelvinSecurityTeam</THREAT_ACTOR> is a hacking collective with some
members from <GEO>Venezuela</GEO>, <GEO>Peru</GEO>, and <GEO>Colombia</GEO>, which is known for selling hacking tools,
carding services, and private data dumps on forums.
While personal information and internal documents require malicious
actors to perform multiple steps to attack the company further (for
example, via specially-crafted phishing campaigns), exposed credentials
provide an easier way to compromise the company via accessing its internal
systems and software in use.
Exposed credentials can be divided into two types:
Leaked credentials. Corporate email logins, with or without passwords, which
are usually being leaked or sold by threat actors on underground forums.
Overall, <ORG>KELA</ORG> discovered more than 100 million exposed Japanese
emails in our sources.

Compromised accounts. Logins and passwords to accounts that grant access
to tools and software used in a compromised environment, such as RDP, VPN
solutions, and more, which are usually being sold through underground
autoshops.

This data can enable attackers to access the company’s resources and provide further
malicious activity, ranging from social engineering to malware attacks. Ultimately,
every leaked data can theoretically become an entry point for large-scale
attacks.
Based on information gathered from multiple darknet sources that <ORG>KELA</ORG> tracks, we
defined that many Japanese corporations, as well as government and educational
entities, are suffering significantly from these types of threats:

Network Accesses: Entry Points to Japanese Networks for Ransomware
Attackers
Initial network accesses, offered on underground forums, can serve as entry points for
ransomware operators and other malicious actors looking for a foothold from where
they can move laterally and deploy ransomware or steal intellectual property. Over the
last three months, <ORG>KELA</ORG> observed several accesses to Japanese organizations being sold
in the darknet. While overall numbers are lower than other countries like the US,
considering the scale of initial network accesses’ sales , each of these accesses can
be turned into millions of ransom demanded by buyers who would manage
to leverage them to infect the victims with ransomware.
The most dangerous offer appears to be related to a remote code execution vulnerability
in the <ORG>Japanese Ministry of Justice</ORG> network. According to a threat actor who posted the
offer for 210,000 JPY, exploiting this vulnerability could grant NT Authority/System
privileges, meaning a high level of permissions.
Another access on sale during the last months allegedly belonged to a “Japan ship
inspection network” and had domain admin level privileges, which enables attackers to
perform malicious actions on behalf of the targeted network’s administrator. It was
offered for 157,000 JPY. Interestingly, one week later, the <MALWARE>Sodinokibi</MALWARE> (<MALWARE>REvil</MALWARE>)
ransomware gang attacked a victim which appears to be the same company based on
the description on the victim’s website — “certification body of ship equipment.”
However, it’s not known if the two incidents were related. Ransomware operators
usually wait for negotiations deadlines to expire before exposing a victim
on their blogs, so it’s hardly possible they would manage both to attack the
victim and lose patience for one week.

Among other offers, <ORG>KELA</ORG> observed access to a Japanese medical university being
offered for 105,000 JPY. The example highlights that despite the pandemic and
the disapproval of some members of the underground community, many
actors continue to target the healthcare industry, as well as the education
sector.

Ransomware Incidents: (At Least) Seven Gangs Targeting Japanese
Organizations
During June-October 2020, at least 11 Japanese victims suffered
ransomware attacks (based on the media reports and data on ransomware gangs’
“naming-and-shaming” portals used to threaten victims, monitored by <ORG>KELA</ORG>
technology), with the most well-known victims being <ORG>Honda</ORG> and <ORG>Canon</ORG>.
The most active ransomware gang targeting Japanese entities appears to be
the <MALWARE>DoppelPaymer</MALWARE> gang. The <MALWARE>DoppelPaymer</MALWARE> ransomware emerged in 2019 and is
believed to have links with former members of the <THREAT_ACTOR>TA505</THREAT_ACTOR> hacking group. This group
has recently attacked four large Japanese companies from the <INDUSTRY>construction</INDUSTRY>, <INDUSTRY>automotive</INDUSTRY>
and <INDUSTRY>manufacturing</INDUSTRY> industries, including a corporation with $1 Billion in revenue, as
well as a German subsidiary of a leading manufacturer of specialty paper in Japan.

Interestingly, one of the victims of <MALWARE>DoppelPaymer</MALWARE> was later claimed to be attacked by
<MALWARE>Conti</MALWARE>, a new ransomware operation that started in August 2020 and believed to be
associated with the <MALWARE>Ryuk</MALWARE> ransomware.

Other ransomware gangs spotted attacking Japanese entities are well-known <MALWARE>Maze</MALWARE>,
<MALWARE>Sodinokibi</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>Ekans</MALWARE> (<MALWARE>Snake</MALWARE>), and two ransomware operations that have recently
adopted a tactic of public shaming – <MALWARE>Egregor</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>LockBit</MALWARE>.

Not much is known about initial infection vectors used to compromise networks of
Japanese victims. However, it’s clear that the attack surface is expanding due to COVID-
19-related issues and increasing trend for remote working, meaning that more and more
employees are using vulnerable software and exposed credentials to access corporate
networks remotely.

For example, one Japanese victim, a manufacturing company, was probably
attacked by <MALWARE>LockBit</MALWARE> using exploit code for a Pulse Secure vulnerability
(CVE-2019-11510). The clue stems from the fact that the company’s IP address was
included in a leak posted on a cybercrime community containing details and credentials
of over 900 enterprise Pulse Secure servers exploited by threat actors.
The victim was first shared by <MALWARE>LockBit</MALWARE> in their thread on a Russian-speaking
underground forum with a domain that had a Chinese TLD, which could indicate it is a
Chinese branch that was attacked. When <MALWARE>LockBit</MALWARE> started their blog a few days later, the
victim appeared there without domains mentioned.

The Pulse Secure leak, for which additional directories were shared several
days later, possibly affects about 117 Japanese entities, based on <ORG>KELA</ORG>’s
analysis of the IP addresses. Darknet chatter on the matter shows that this
information has been circulated between malicious actors before the leak
that happened in August 2020. Therefore, credentials to affected Japanese
organizations’ Pulse Secure servers could be used by different actors in their malicious
campaigns, including ransomware attacks.

Conclusions and Mitigation Efforts
As can be concluded from this research, more and more threat actors, Advanced <THREAT_ACTOR>APT</THREAT_ACTOR>
group and nation state actors are considering Japanese organizations as valuable
targets and are actively attacking them via opportunistic and targeted attacks.
Given the latest “work from home” trend and the increased attack surface, <ORG>KELA</ORG> has
observed many commercial and governmental Japanese entities being recently attacked
by known actors – from ransomware gangs to nation-state actors and other financially
motivated groups. They’re using multiple attack vectors aimed to compromise Japanese
entities, gain a foothold into their network and steal sensitive information and funds.
<ORG>KELA</ORG> strongly believes that real-time monitoring of darknet communities for both
supply and demand can hold significant intelligence value for Japanese defenders. It
enables Japanese entities to be more proactive to threats, learn about new tactics used
by malicious actors, and take measures to protect against them.
In our next blog post, we will cover the Japanese financial ecosystem and the
opportunities threat actors see in targeting both the consumer and the organizations’
sides.
