OPERATION ARID VIPER
Targets
Threat intelligence from within <ORG>Trend Micro</ORG> was used to determine who
the targets of an ongoing campaign dubbed “<CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN>” have
been so far. Based on IP addresses associated with malware infections
tied to the campaign’s core infrastructure, we were able to determine its
targets—a government office, transport service/infrastructure providers,
a military organization, and an academic institution in Israel. It also
targeted an academic institution in <GEO>Kuwait</GEO> along with several other
unidentified Israeli individuals.
Research also revealed an interesting Twitter conversation between
@Ramzi_MHADHBI, a Tunisian blogger, and @waleedassar, a reverse
engineer currently working as a senior security researcher at the <ORG>Al
Jazeera Media Network</ORG>. Their exchange mentioned two of the domains
associated with <MALWARE>Operation Arid Viper</MALWARE> malware, suggesting that one or
both of them may have also been targeted. <CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN> targeted
various Israeli organizations
across industries.
Infection Chain
As will be made clear later, Operation <THREAT_ACTOR>Arid Viper</THREAT_ACTOR> aimed to extract victim
information though it also paid much attention to its means of getting
into target systems. The campaign used the most popular targeted
attack infection vector—a simple phishing email from a nonexistent
sender to a specific recipient. It targeted organizations from various
industries with a clear focus on Israel.
The spear-phishing email came with a compressed file attachment
and a more or less credible social engineering ploy to trick victims into
opening it and running the embedded .EXE file. The .RAR file Twitter conversation between
attachment contains an .SCR file that when executed drops two more @<IDENTITY>Ramzi_MHADHBI</IDENTITY> and
files onto an infected system. One file is a short pornographic video in @waleedassar
.FLV or .MPG format, depending on the samples seen. The other file is
a Windows® binary file sporting the icon of the well-known Internet
communication program, Skype™.
Operation <THREAT_ACTOR>Arid</THREAT_ACTOR> <THREAT_ACTOR>Viper</THREAT_ACTOR> was unusual in that it had a pornographic component in hopes
of taking user focus away from the infection or the fact that something strange is
happening. It targeted professionals who might be receiving very inappropriate
content at work and so would hesitate to report the incident. These victims’ failure to
act on the threat could have then allowed the main malware to remain undiscovered.
The attackers used a distinct and likely successful strategy previously unseen when it
came to avoiding incident response team investigations.

<CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN> Research Paper
It is also worth mentioning that variations in the spear-phishing
elements were seen across attacks though the idea behind them was
the same. They all used a socially engineered email with a malicious file
attachment and had a pornographic element as shown in the infection
chain.
Once executed, the binary accesses a command-and-control (C&C)
server to immediately download an updated module and check if the
infected system is already known or if it has been newly infected.
Each infected system is assigned a unique identifier comprising
its hard disk name and a specific set of numbers. Specific URLs
are used for command and control. Note how often the unique
identifier is used in all kinds of communication with C&C servers.
Below are sample commands for a system with the unique ID,

When the second-stage malware runs, it sets itself to auto-
run with each system reboot in the guise of an Internet
communication software. This is accomplished with an old-
fashioned auto-start registry key such as HKCU\SOFTWARE\
Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run—“Skype = <path\
name.exe”>. This keeps the path and name of the .EXE
file dropped into the registry key. It also copies itself into
%SystemDrive%\Program Files\Messenger via a hard-coded
path. In addition to using “Skype” in the registry, the malware
also frequently spoofed the Skype icon. All of the malware
samples seen had portable executable (PE) file sections
written in Arabic.
The malware logs in to the C&C console by calling a very
specific PHP script on the C&C server—/products/add_user.ph
p?name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive—1268730784&user=38.
The number it creates for the user parameter—38 in the
example—was chosen from the malware client to identify
the session. It then starts searching the whole hard disk for
documents—.DOC, .XLS, .PPT, and .TXT files. Each document The Wireshark log (top) shows the files
found is reported to the C&C server using the format, GET / the malware sends to a C&C server.

user/Templates/winword.doc.

<CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN> Research Paper
The C&C server immediately responds if each document is interesting or not. This
decision probably comes from a hard-coded black list on the server side to likely
prevent the client from sending out default templates and generic readme.txt files.
The server also tries to avoid requesting for duplicates of files it already has in further
stealing sessions. It has two possible responses:
• Response for an interesting document:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 02 Oct 2014 14:49:45 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.10 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.0.1e-fips mod_

bwlimited/1.4
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.16
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html

The client then proceeds to list down all of the interesting documents to steal. These
are compressed in a 0.txt file and uploaded to a C&C server via a POST request such
as POST /products/fupdates.php. This request comprises a single POST parameter
formatted as a GET parameter such as account=38&name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardD
rive—1268730784&folder=tree&fname=02-10-2014 10-50.rml&s=<base64-file>.
The server presumably uses the account value, which is the same as the previously
mentioned user value, to track sessions where particular files are uploaded. The
fname parameter is the .ZIP file’s name and contains a specific date and time. The
0.txt file is deleted after the upload.
At the end of the file upload, the client issues the request, /products/all_file_info1.ph
p?name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive—1268730784&user=38&file=02-10-2014%20
10-50.rml&type=tree, to make sure everything went smoothly.
As shown, a single execution allows the malware client to steal documents from
infected systems. After carrying out all of its routines, the malware routinely checks
back with the C&C server to see if it should continue running using the path,
/products/get_statu.php?name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive—1268730784. A
response containing run11 tells it to continue running whereas stop disables it to
possibly avoid infecting uninteresting systems.

Operation Arid Viper Research Paper
C&C Infrastructure
Using an initial malware sample and its corresponding C&C server,
we looked through internal <ORG>Trend Micro</ORG> databases to compile a list of
similar malware that contact the same server. All cases revealed that the
malware essentially exhibited the same behaviors previously outlined.
The first C&C server found was pstcmedia.com. A quick search
revealed that another site—mixedwork.com—hosted on the same IP
address—188.40.81.136—also acted as a C&C server. Although the
pstcmedia.com site changed IP addresses, mixedwork.com seemed to
stay on this IP address. The other IP addresses pstcmedia.com used
include 192.254.132.26 and 54.255.143.112. The second IP address has
been sink-holed by other security researchers.
To find other domains that may be part of the same campaign or used by
the same perpetrators, an investigation of domain registration data was
conducted. The C&C server that pstcmedia.com used was registered
using the personal email address, khalid.samraa@gmail.com. More
details on this can be found in the attribution section.
The main page of mixedwork.com also contained a decoy redirection to
the legitimate site, http://channel9.msdn.com/events/mix. But on its 404
page, it is interesting to note the mention of the email address, ahmed.
jmal1989@gmail.com, as site administrator.
An in-depth look at <ORG>Trend Micro™</ORG> Smart Protection Network™ feedback
for network activity similar to the previously mentioned URL paths
allowed us to identify where the following active C&C servers were at
various times:
• ahmedfaiez.info
• flushupdate.com
• flushupate.com
• ineltdriver.info
• mediahitech.com
The first three servers have all been hosted at some point on the same
IP addresses—188.40.75.132 and 188.40.106.84—located in <GEO>Hetzner</GEO>,
<GEO>Germany</GEO>. A more in-depth look at the first IP address revealed that
among several other domains, it also hosts two—advtravel.info and
fpupdate.info—that have clear ties to cybercriminal activities although not
necessarily to the same campaign being investigated.
A closer look at the last two C&C servers revealed that they have been
misconfigured and allowed directory listing. Inside them were large
amounts of victim data analyzed in the Operation Advtravel section.

OPERATION ADVTRAVEL
Ongoing <CAMPAIGN>Operation Advtravel</CAMPAIGN> differed from <CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN> in terms of the
malware used, their chosen victims, and attribution information. But it does bear
certain similarities to <CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN> that we believe merits its addition to this
paper. The cybercriminals behind this campaign may have some ties with the threat
actors behind <CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN>, which include:
• They shared servers for command and control.
• They used the same email addresses to register their domains—advtravel.
info, fpupdate.info, and linksis.info.
• Their perpetrators had ties to the <GEO>Gaza</GEO> Strip.
C&C Infrastructure
While conducting our investigation, we came across an Advtravel C&C
server that shared the same infrastructure with <CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN>.
It is particularly interesting to note that the advtravel.info site left its
server’s root directory structure completely open to the public. This,
combined with some other cybercriminal activities elaborated in the
attribution section, led us to believe that the <CAMPAIGN>Advtravel</CAMPAIGN> attackers were
less-skilled than those behind <CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN>.
Publicly accessible <CAMPAIGN>Advtravel</CAMPAIGN>
An analysis of December 2014 data shows that <CAMPAIGN>Advtravel</CAMPAIGN>’s C&C server site root directory
directory could be publicly accessed. This allowed us to download copies
of its entire content to study as part of our investigation before its owners
realized their mistake and locked it down. Earlier versions of data from
September 2014 were also downloaded.
The advtravel.info directory had several files and folders. Although we were not able
to exhaustively analyze every file on it, details on its most interesting components are
highlighted below:
• B1312.zip: This is a 1.4GB compressed backup of all of the other files on the
C&C server. Leaving this file on the server allowed us to look inside the code
of the .PHP files the attackers used.
• /apps/: This main directory contains stolen victim data, along with several
PHP scripts that uploaded it to the server. It used the format, /apps/A[3
nums]X/[COMPUTERNAME_USERNAME] where A[3 nums]X represents a
particular subcampaign while /[COMPUTERNAME_USERNAME] identifies a
unique victim. The three digits in the folder format seem to indicate the month
of the year, as they ranged from 001 to 012. Further analysis of the dates
when the data was stolen, however, disproved that theory.
An exhaustive analysis of every file on the server is beyond the scope of this
paper but the details of the most interesting components are:

Malware
An analysis of the stolen files and logs allowed us to come up with a brief description
of the initial <MALWARE>Advtravel</MALWARE> malware. In general, it only serves to respond to a C&C server.
The attackers then manually downloaded other tools onto infected systems to extract
victim credentials.
13 | Page © 2015 <ORG>Trend Micro</ORG> Incorporated

<CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN> Research Paper
After the initial dropper or download chain, the malware starts its
data-stealing routine. It calls home to a C&C server and report each
folder found on the infected system. The server then replies with a
confirmation on whether or not the malware should send the folders’
contents.
The <MALWARE>Advtravel</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>Operation Arid Viper</MALWARE> malware had similar behaviors.
This may or may not be a coincidence, as their binaries significantly
differed. The <MALWARE>Advtravel</MALWARE> malware was coded in C# so the dropper needs
to go through additional steps to build and update a .NET-running
environment where it can be executed. This involves downloads and
Microsoft™ software installations, which not only caused significant
infection delays but also served as an additional point of failure to
execute.
The following are some sample HTTP requests seen in Operation
<MALWARE>Advtravel</MALWARE>:
• GET/sys/who.php?t=2/8/2015%205:30:59%20AM HTTP/1.1: Possible <MALWARE>Advtravel</MALWARE> malware
First-time login. infection chain
• GET/sys/genid.php?t=2/8/2015%205:31:00%20AM: Asks to
generate a unique ID for a particular first-time client. The ID
returned in this example was 2aMUu7TcPbUBsHVLNogB.vic,
which will be used by the bot client throughout.
• POST/sys/upload.php?dirname=//2aMUu7TcPbUBsHVLNogB.vic&x=old:
Send directory name information.
• GET/sys/data//2aMUu7TcPbUBsHVLNogB.vic/command.
cmd?t=2/8/2015%205:31:02%20AM: Get a command from the server.
In one particular example, the initial malware was a self-extracting .CAB file that
eventually downloaded the main malware and patver.tmp, which contains the value,
A012X. This value indicates the server folder where the stolen data should be
uploaded to. This is essentially a campaign identifier. The malware then dropped
a .JPG file showing the famous Dome of the Rock Church in <GEO>Jerusalem</GEO>. It also
exhibited the following behaviors:
• Installs itself to a default location such as C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\Roaming\
AdobeAPP or C:\Documents and Settings\[USER]\Application Data\explr
• Puts logs and support files in C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\Roaming\AdobeAPP\
temp (Note that the .EXE file varies and appears to be downloaded on
demand.)
• Uses many of the support files previously described in another section, which
are found in the \temp folder
• Can send commands such as the following to bots:

Victims
The <MALWARE>Advtravel</MALWARE> server has more than 500 infected systems. All of the stolen details
found on it have been backed up for evidence. Most of the data have been analyzed
to get an idea as to who have been victimized by the campaign. Some observations
made include:
• The majority of victims appeared to be Arabs from <GEO>Egypt</GEO>.
• All of the infected systems appeared to be personal laptops, judging by the
presence of a battery indicator in screenshots. This led us to believe that the
campaign was not as sophisticated or as targeted as <CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN>.
15 | Page © 2015 <ORG>Trend Micro</ORG> Incorporated

<CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN> Research Paper
• The attackers appear to be keenly interested in images stored on victims’
systems. This could be a sign that they are looking for incriminating or
compromising images for blackmail purposes. As such, the attackers may be
less-skilled hackers who are not after financial gain nor hacking for espionage
purposes.
• A lot of the screenshots unusually showed open <ORG>Facebook</ORG> profiles. The
victims either spent a lot of time on <ORG>Facebook</ORG> every day or the malware took
screenshots every time a victim accessed the site. This allowed the attackers
to identify their victims. More details on this will be revealed after further
investigation.
fpupdate.info Server
The fpupdate.info server’s main directory contains a /mobile/ folder.
At the time of writing, the site no longer allowed public access to
the server’s files although we were able to back them up back in
September 2014.
At present, all of the related .PHP files cannot access the server’s
back-end database, which could mean it is down or unmaintained. An
uploads folder had two subfolders that contained personal information
stolen from victims’ mobile phones. Each subfolder had another two
subfolders—/calllog and /sms. We were, however, unable to obtain a
copy of the Android™ malware the attackers may have used to create fpupdate.info main directory
the logs.
VICTIMS
The fpupdate.info server contained phone data stolen from two victims, Victim data stored on
namely: fpupdate.info
• LGE_IMEI: The device’s International Mobile Station Equipment Identity
(IMEI) number revealed that it was an LG D821 Nexus 5 phone owned
by someone from Israel. Call logs containing several Israel-based phone
numbers, some of which had corresponding contact names, were found on
the server. One particular contact called My Number belonged to someone
from Palestine.
• SAMSUNG_IMEI: This device’s IMEI number revealed that it was a <ORG>Samsung</ORG>
P5100 Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 owned by someone from Israel. Logs indicating
calls made to several Israel-based phone numbers were found, along with
SMS logs. Most of the text messages were tweets by @shadipal2 and
@Alaqsavoice_Brk, users who relayed real-time news about <GEO>Gaza</GEO>. The other
text messages, meanwhile, revealed meetings in places in <GEO>Tunisia</GEO> such as
<GEO>Gafsa</GEO> and <GEO>Sakiet Eddaier</GEO>.

LINKSIS.INFO SERVER
In addition to the two previously mentioned servers, linksis.info has also been found
to have a very similar open directory layout to advtravel.info. It also used a lot of the
same malware. We have not completely explored this server though a quick look
clearly revealed ties to advtravel.info, including:
• It is hosted on the same IP address—188.40.106.84—located in Hetzner,
Germany.
• Its DNS SOA record used the email address, mahmoud.hashem12@gmail.
com.
• It has an http://www.linksis.info/sys/del/belal/ folder, which is owned by one of
the users of advtravel.info’s C&C control panels.
• It contains the same log files—webbrowser.txt and so on—although these
were encrypted.
ATTRIBUTION
The individuals identified in this section have some apparent connection with
<CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN> or <CAMPAIGN>Advtravel</CAMPAIGN>. <ORG>Trend Micro</ORG> would, however, like to point out
that they may or may not be involved with cybercrime. We simply intend to lay out
verified facts that link them to the campaigns’ infrastructure and malware. Several
other reasons such as having their email accounts stolen and used to register C&C
servers, deliberate impersonation, and the like could also account for their links to the
campaigns.

Two Facebook pages <IDENTITY>Samra</IDENTITY> has ties to
samraa@gmail.com, khalid.samraa@hotmail.com, khalid.samraa@wwb.ps, and
khalid.samraa@coreions.com.
To get a better idea as to what sort of person <IDENTITY>Samra</IDENTITY> is and to determine if he may
have a motive for taking part in the campaigns, we took a look at his other social
networking accounts. He apparently has two <ORG>Facebook</ORG> accounts—https://www.
facebook.com/khaled.a.samraa and https://www.facebook.com/khalid.k.abusamra.
The email address for the first account was used to register one of <CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid
Viper</CAMPAIGN>’s C&C servers. The publicly visible profile pictures also suggest that he owned
all three accounts. The accounts indicate that he lives in Gaza and that he has pro-
Palestine and anti-Israeli political beliefs.
18 | Page © 2015 <ORG>Trend Micro</ORG> Incorporated

<CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN> Research Paper
What appears to be <IDENTITY>Samra</IDENTITY>’s second <ORG>Facebook</ORG> account also indicates
that he is from Gaza. It also mentions where he worked, Coreions,
like his <ORG>LinkedIn</ORG> profile. Unlike the first account though, this has more
ties to several members of his family. Photographs posted on it also
clearly show his presence in <GEO>Gaza</GEO> in 2012. A further Facebook search
for the email address, khalid.samraa@gmail.com, also pointed to a
group page called “GazaUnderFire2012” (https://www.facebook.com/
GazaUnderFire2014), which <IDENTITY>Samra</IDENTITY> apparently set up back in 2012. This
page then led to a newer group page called “Gaza Under Attack 2014”
(https://www.facebook.com/gazaunderattack2014). Both of the pages
provide updates on the ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict with a very
strong pro-Palestine/-Hamas and anti-Israeli focus, just like the personal
<IDENTITY>Samra</IDENTITY> Facebook accounts.
Apart from the <ORG>Facebook</ORG> accounts, <IDENTITY>Samra</IDENTITY> had other social networking
accounts such as in <ORG>Twitter</ORG> (https://twitter.com/KhalidSamraa), <ORG>Google</ORG>+

On 4 November 2011, Coreions’ Whois record again changed. Although
all of the major details remained the same, the email address was
changed to khalid.samraa@gmail.com. On 13 January 2012, its entire

<THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>
As previously mentioned, several advtravel.info infection logs can be clearly
linked to <THREAT_ACTOR>Operation Advtravel</THREAT_ACTOR>’s malware developers or bot masters. It is also worth
remembering that the malware used in <CAMPAIGN>Operations Advtravel</CAMPAIGN> and <CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid
Viper</CAMPAIGN> distinctly differed from each other though they shared a common network
infrastructure. The logs showed that the infection started from the same folder
Visual Studio® drops a compiled file into and that screenshots showed other
malware present on advtravel.info. This shows that advtravel.info is a development
environment and could very likely be where the malware are programmed. The
server’s username is <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>. A close look at other log files allowed us to find at
least three other systems with the same user. Some of the samples gathered from
the <ORG>Trend Micro</ORG> sample database listed down <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR> as an internal author as
well.
20 | Page © 2015 <ORG>Trend Micro</ORG> Incorporated

<CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN> Research Paper
The bot logs from Dev_hima look
like logs from test environments
with different virtual machines that
belonged to the original developer
who performed some debugging
and testing. This mistake went
even further, as while testing the
malware, it took several screenshots
of <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>’s system, which gave
us some insight into his operations.
The CPanel display in a Windows 8
environment showed how he went
through victim logs. Other tabs open
in the same browser display his
Facebook profile page.
The control panel is a Windows tool Screenshot of <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>’s system stored on advtravel.info
called “DHSDM.” Its icon can also
be seen as the rightmost program
on the taskbar. This can be found
on several of Dev_hima’s test virtual
machines. It also showed that Dev_
hima corresponded to the Admin
user of the control panel. Other
details recovered from logs revealed
an IP address geolocated in Cairo,
Egypt.
Another clue to <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>’s relation
to the <MALWARE>Advtravel</MALWARE> malware was a
working downloader from December
2014 that is related to advtravel.
info. It downloaded a malware from
a server that is then run on infected
systems. The PE header data of
this downloader again showed the Information on a malware variant published by <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>
name, <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR> as application
publisher. <MALWARE>Nveron</MALWARE> appears to be <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_
hima</THREAT_ACTOR>’s filename for the malware.
A web search for developers with the nickname, <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>, turned up one profile that
fit what we know so far very well. <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR> was not exactly hiding online. He actually
had various online accounts—http://devhima.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html, http://
devhima.webs.com/about, youtube.com/user/ibrahhm2121/, facebook.com/devhima,
twitter.com/dev_hima, linkedin.com/pub/ebrahim-elsharawy/69/324/7b5, scribd.com/
devhima, soundcloud.com/ebrahim-elsharawy, and devhima.tumblr.com—that tie his
real identity to his nickname.
21 | Page © 2015 <ORG>Trend Micro</ORG> Incorporated

<CAMPAIGN>Operation Arid Viper</CAMPAIGN> Research Paper
<THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR> can also be tied to the
Skype ID, ibrahhm2121, along
with the email addresses, dev_

that a malicious hacker sought to
appropriate <IDENTITY>El Sharawy</IDENTITY>’s identity
or coincidentally chose the same Some of <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>’s social networking profiles
nickname.
A look at malicious activities tied to
the nickname, <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>, revealed
very interesting things. We found
that <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR> was part of the
“<THREAT_ACTOR>Gaza Hacker Team</THREAT_ACTOR>,” a group
involved in multiple website hacking
and defacement incidents against
Israeli targets in the past. A few of
the more than 2,000 defacement
attacks the team carried out
involved sites in Israel.
Some of <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>’s hacker group
profiles can also be found on gaza-
hacker.org/cc/member-u_42271.
html and arabteam2000-forum.com/
index.php/user/272853-dev-hima/.
His personal project page—http://
devhima.webs.com/—showed <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR> also has ties to several email addresses and online
several potentially malicious tools accounts
that he has coded. <MALWARE>DevPcTwitter</MALWARE>, for
instance, allows attackers to control a
target system using a <ORG>Twitter</ORG> account. <MALWARE>DevSpy</MALWARE>, meanwhile, allows parents to monitor
their children’s online communication and browsing habits for protection purposes. In
reality though, <MALWARE>DevSpy</MALWARE> is simply a piece of spyware.
<MALWARE>DevPcTwitter</MALWARE> (MD5: bfcb492d282960152a366b5760b87920d02c6e83) is publicly
available for download on <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>’s site.
The structure of the last four <MALWARE>DevPcTwitter</MALWARE> commands—getfile*[file_path]—is
interesting. The commands had a similar though not identical syntax to the format
<THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>’s bot used to communicate with advtravel.info.
<THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR> shared tutorial videos on YouTube on how to configure and use

is also available for public download from http://
devhima.webs.com/. Unlike <MALWARE>DevPcTwitter</MALWARE>, the
<MALWARE>DevSpy</MALWARE> interface uses English, not Arabic. Its
setup is also pretty self-explanatory. It takes
desktop screenshots at user-specified intervals
that it then stores in a folder. It can stealthily run
in the background. In stealth mode though, it can
be only be accessed by pressing a hotkey that
requires password authentication. In the same
mode, <MALWARE>DevSpy</MALWARE> can remove itself from a victim’s
Windows Task Manager process list.
<MALWARE>DevSpy</MALWARE> is medium- to high-risk because it is
designed to spy on users in stealth mode. It is
possible or even likely that the malware used to
communicate with advtravel.info is a privately
enhanced version of <THREAT_ACTOR>Dev_hima</THREAT_ACTOR>’s
tools.

<IDENTITY>Fathy Mostafa</IDENTITY> is another individual with apparent connections to <CAMPAIGN>Operation Advtravel</CAMPAIGN>.
In one of the advtravel.info logs, we saw a screenshot of the main <MALWARE>Advtravel</MALWARE> malware
under development.
The code showed testing URLs that used the same paths as the actual malware that
accessed the advtravel.info domain. The username, fathy, can clearly be seen. Other
logs from the same infection gave us some stolen account details, including:
• http://members.000webhost.com/login.php was registered using

Mostafa’s’s skills, according to work profile sites, include C# programming, which was
coincidentally used to program the <MALWARE>Advtravel</MALWARE> malware.
