When a Germany-based industrial conglomerate disclosed in December 2016 that it was breached early that year, the breach was revealed to be a professionally
run industrial espionage attack. According to the German press, the intruders used the <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> family of malware as their main implant, giving them persistent
access to the conglomerate’s network as early as February 2016.
In this blog, we look at the <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> malware implant as used by two known activity groups <THREAT_ACTOR>BARIUM</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR>. We look at how these activity groups introduce the
implant to various targets and techniques used by <ORG>Microsoft</ORG> researchers to track the implant.
To show how this breach and similar breaches can be mitigated, we look at how Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) flags
activities associated with <THREAT_ACTOR>BARIUM</THREAT_ACTOR>, <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR>, and other known activity groups and how it provides extensive threat intelligence about these groups. We go through
the <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> implant installation process and explore how Windows Defender ATP can capture such attacker methods and tools and provide visualized contextual
information that can aid in actual attack investigation and response. We then discuss how centralized response options, provided as enhancements to Windows

Defender ATP with the Windows 10 Creators Update, can be used to quickly stop threats, including stopping command and control (C&C) communication and
preventing existing implants from installing additional components or from moving laterally to other computers on the network.

<MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> activity groups: <THREAT_ACTOR>BARIUM</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR>
Microsoft Threat Intelligence associates <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> with multiple activity groups—collections of malware, supporting infrastructure, online personas, victimology, and
other attack artifacts that the <ORG>Microsoft</ORG> intelligent security graph uses to categorize and attribute threat activity. <ORG>Microsoft</ORG> labels activity groups using code
names derived from elements in the periodic table. In the case of this malware, the activity groups strongly associated with <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> are <THREAT_ACTOR>BARIUM</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR>. But
even though they share the use of <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE>, the <THREAT_ACTOR>BARIUM</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR> activity groups are involved in very different intrusion scenarios.
<THREAT_ACTOR>BARI</THREAT_ACTOR>UM begins its attacks by cultivating relationships with potential victims—particularly those working in <INDUSTRY>Business Development</INDUSTRY> or <INDUSTRY>Human Resources</INDUSTRY>—on
various social media platforms. Once <THREAT_ACTOR>BARIUM</THREAT_ACTOR> has established rapport, they spear-phish the victim using a variety of unsophisticated malware installation vectors,
including malicious shortcut (.lnk) files with hidden payloads, compiled HTML help (.chm) files, or Microsoft Office documents containing macros or exploits.
Initial intrusion stages feature the <MALWARE>Win32/Barlaiy</MALWARE> implant—notable for its use of social network profiles, collaborative document editing sites, and blogs for C&C.
Later stages of the intrusions rely upon <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> for persistent access. The majority of victims recorded to date have been in electronic gaming, multimedia, and
Internet content industries, although occasional intrusions against technology companies have occurred.
In contrast, <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR> has established a far greater reputation for industrial espionage. In the past few years, <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR>’s victims have included:
• Multinational, multi-industry companies involved in the <INDUSTRY>manufacture</INDUSTRY> of <INDUSTRY>textiles</INDUSTRY>, <INDUSTRY>chemicals</INDUSTRY>, and <INDUSTRY>electronics</INDUSTRY>
• <INDUSTRY>Pharmaceutical</INDUSTRY> companies
• A company in the <INDUSTRY>chemical industry</INDUSTRY>
• University faculty specializing in <INDUSTRY>aeronautical engineering</INDUSTRY> and <INDUSTRY>research</INDUSTRY>
• A company involved in the <INDUSTRY>design</INDUSTRY> and <INDUSTRY>manufacture</INDUSTRY> of <INDUSTRY>motor vehicles</INDUSTRY>
• A <INDUSTRY>cybersecurity</INDUSTRY> company focusing on protecting industrial control systems

During these intrusions, <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR>’s objective was to steal sensitive data, including research materials, process documents, and project plans. <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR> also steals code-
signing certificates to sign its malware in subsequent attacks.
In most cases, <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR>’s attacks do not feature any advanced exploit techniques. The group also does not make special effort to cultivate victims prior to an attack.
Instead, the group often simply emails a <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> installer to potential victims, relying on basic social engineering tactics to convince recipients to run the attached
malware. In some other cases, <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR> gains access to a target by brute-forcing remote access login credentials, performing SQL injection, or exploiting unpatched
web servers, and then they copy the <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> installer directly to compromised machines.
Tracking <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE>
Microsoft Analytics shows that <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> has been used in intrusions carried out throughout <GEO>Asia</GEO>, <GEO>Europe</GEO>, <GEO>Oceania</GEO>, the <GEO>Middle East</GEO>, and the <GEO>United States</GEO> in the last
six months (Figure 1). The most recent series of attacks observed was in December 2016.
Figure 1. <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> encounters from July to December 2016
Although tracking threats like <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> involves old-fashioned investigative work, <ORG>Microsoft Threat Intelligence</ORG> analysts take advantage of machine learning to
work at scale. When attackers used <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> to maintain access to web servers, they hid the implant in plain sight by masquerading it as a trusted, legitimate file.

This was the case in two known intrusions in 2015, where attackers named the implant DLL “ASPNET_FILTER.DLL” to disguise it as the DLL for the ASP.NET ISAPI
Filter (Table 1). Although there are obvious differences between the legitimate file and the malicious one, filtering out the malicious file would involve going
through a data set with noise from millions of possible file names, software publishers, and certificates. <ORG>Microsoft</ORG> researchers used a combination of anomaly
detection and supervised machine learning to reduce the data set and separate meaningful, malware-related anomalies from benign data.

Dealing with <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> intrusions
Windows Defender ATP helps network security professionals deal with intrusions from activity groups like <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>BARIUM</THREAT_ACTOR> in several ways. The following
examples were developed using a <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> installer that was used in attacks in December 2016.
Alerts for breach activity
Microsoft Threat Intelligence continually tracks activity groups such as <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>BARIUM</THREAT_ACTOR> and documents the tactics, techniques, and procedures they employ in
their attacks, with a special focus on the tools and infrastructure they use to facilitate those attacks. Windows Defender ATP continuously monitors protected
systems for such indicators of hostile activity and alerts security operations center (SOC) personnel to their presence (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Threat intelligence alert in Windows Defender ATP
To provide context around such alerts, Windows Defender ATP also features a short summary of the group’s history, goals, methods, and tools (Figure 3), with
links to extensive documentation for technically minded users.
Figure 3. Lead activity group summary and extensive documentation
Windows Defender ATP is also capable of detecting previously unknown attacks by monitoring system behavior indicative of hostile activity, including:

• Malware installation, persistence, and activation
• Backdoor command and control
• Credential theft
• Lateral movement to other machines on the network
For example, numerous malware families register themselves as services during installation to guarantee persistence across reboots. A majority of malware that
perform this persistence technique modify the necessary registry keys in ways that do not fit the profile of a legitimate program. <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> is no exception, and so,
during <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE>’s installation process, Windows Defender ATP is able to raise behavioral alerts (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Abnormal service creation alert
To improve coverage while minimizing false positives, Windows Defender ATP uses the intelligent security graph to differentiate between suspicious and benign
behavior before generating alerts. It considers the age of the file, its global prevalence, and the presence and validity of a digital signature along with the
method of service creation.
Visualized contextual information
For alerts raised either by specific threat intelligence tied to activity groups or by more generic suspicious behaviors, Windows Defender ATP provides rich,
visualized technical context. This visual context enables SOC personnel to investigate alerts with all related artifacts, understand the scope of the breach, and
prepare a comprehensive action plan. In the screenshots below, Windows Defender ATP clearly presents the <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> installation where an installer drops a DLL to
disk (Figure 5), loads the DLL using rundll32 (Figure 6), sets the DLL as a service (Figure 7), and saves a copy of itself in C:\Windows\Help (Figure 8).

Figure 6. <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> installer loads DLL with rundll32

Figure 7. <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> sets itself as a service for persistence
Figure 8. Installer copied to C:\Windows\Help\
Windows Defender ATP displays these activities as process trees in a machine timeline for the infected computer. Analysts can easily extract detailed information
from these trees, such as the implant DLL dropped by the installer, the command used to call rundll32.exe and load the DLL, and the registry modifications that
set the DLL as a service. This information can provide an initial means by which to assess the scope of the breach.

Response options
The Windows 10 Creators Update will bring several enhancements to Windows Defender ATP that will provide SOC personnel with options for immediate
mitigation of a detected threat. If an intruder compromises a computer that has been onboarded to Windows Defender ATP, SOC personnel can isolate the
computer from the network, blocking command and control of the implant and preventing attackers from installing additional malware and moving laterally to
other computers in the network. Meanwhile, connectivity to the Windows Defender ATP service is maintained. While the machine is in isolation, SOC personnel
can direct the infected machine to collect live investigation data, such as the DNS cache or security event logs, which they can use to verify alerts, assess the state
of the intrusion, and support follow-up actions.

Figure 9. Response options for the compromised machine
Another option is to simply halt and quarantine the <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> implant itself, stopping the intrusion on a single machine. <THREAT_ACTOR>LEAD</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>BARIUM</THREAT_ACTOR> are not known for large-
scale spear-phishing, so it is unlikely that SOC personnel would have to deal with multiple machines having been compromised by these groups at the same
time. Nevertheless, Windows Defender ATP also supports blocking the implant across the entire enterprise, stopping large-scale intrusions in the early stages
(Figure 10).

Conclusion: Shorten breach detection times to reduce impact
According to news reports, the incident affecting the industrial conglomerate may have taken several months to detect and mitigate. The time between the
actual breach and its detection may have given attackers enough time to locate sensitive information and exfiltrate this information.
With the enhanced post-breach detection capabilities of Windows Defender ATP, SOC personnel are able to reduce this period to hours or even minutes,
significantly lessening the potential impact of persistent attacker access to their network. Windows Defender ATP provides extensive information about activity
groups responsible for the attacks, enabling customers to understand aspects of the attack that may not be obtained by network and endpoint sensors, such as
common social engineering lures and the regional nature of an attack. With relevant visualized information, analysts are able to study malware behavior on
impacted machines, so they can investigate further and plan out their response. And, finally, with the upcoming Creators Update, Windows Defender ATP will
provide additional capabilities for detecting threats such as <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE>, as well as centralized response options, such as machine isolation and file blocking, that will
enable fast containment of known attack jump off points.
Windows Defender ATP is built into the core of Windows 10 Enterprise and can be evaluated free of charge.
