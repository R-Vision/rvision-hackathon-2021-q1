For more than three years, the <ORG>Global Research and Analysis Team</ORG> (<ORG>GReAT</ORG>) at <ORG>Kaspersky</ORG>
has been publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity. The
summaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative
snapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT
reports. They are designed to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people
should be aware of.
This is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q3 2020.
Readers who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more
information on a specific report are encouraged to contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.
The most remarkable findings
We have already partly documented the activities of <THREAT_ACTOR>DeathStalker</THREAT_ACTOR>, a unique threat group that
seems to focus mainly on law firms and companies operating in the financial sector. The
group’s interest in gathering sensitive business information leads us to believe that
<THREAT_ACTOR>DeathStalker</THREAT_ACTOR> is a group of mercenaries offering hacking-for-hire services, or acting as an
information broker in financial circles. The activities of this threat actor first came to our
attention through a PowerShell-based implant called Powersing. This quarter, we unraveled
the threads of <THREAT_ACTOR>DeathStalker</THREAT_ACTOR>’s LNK-based Powersing intrusion workflow. While there is
nothing groundbreaking in the whole toolset, we believe defenders can gain a lot of value by
understanding the underpinnings of a modern, albeit low-tech, infection chain used by a
successful threat actor. <THREAT_ACTOR>DeathStalker</THREAT_ACTOR> continues to develop and use this implant, using tactics
that have mostly been identical since 2018, while making greater efforts to evade detection.
In August, our public report of <THREAT_ACTOR>DeathStalker</THREAT_ACTOR>’s activities summarized the three scripting
language-based toolchains used by the group – <MALWARE>Powersing</MALWARE>, <MALWARE>Janicab</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>Evilnum</MALWARE>.
Following our initial private report on <THREAT_ACTOR>Evilnum</THREAT_ACTOR>, we detected a new batch of implants in late
June 2020, showing interesting changes in the (so far) quite static modus operandi of
<THREAT_ACTOR>DeathStalker</THREAT_ACTOR>. For instance, the malware directly connects to a C2 server using an embedded
IP address or domain name, as opposed to previous variants where it made use of at least
two dead drop resolvers (DDRs) or web services, such as forums and code sharing platforms,
to fetch the real C2 IP address or domain. Interestingly, for this campaign the attackers
didn’t limit themselves merely to sending spear-phishing emails but actively engaged victims
through multiple emails, persuading them to open the decoy, to increase the chance of
compromise. Furthermore, aside from using Python-based implants throughout the
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2020/99204/ 1/8

11/4/2020 APT trends report Q3 2020 | Securelist
intrusion cycle, in both new and old variants, this was the first time that we had seen the
actor dropping PE binaries as intermediate stages to load <MALWARE>Evilnum</MALWARE>, while using advanced
techniques to evade and bypass security products.
We also found another intricate, low-tech implant that we attribute to <MALWARE>DeathStalker</MALWARE> with
medium confidence. The delivery workflow uses a Microsoft Word document and drops a
previously unknown PowerShell implant that relies on DNS over HTTPS (DoH) as a C2
channel. We dubbed this implant <MALWARE>PowerPepper</MALWARE>.
During a recent investigation of a targeted campaign, we found a UEFI firmware image
containing rogue components that drop previously unknown malware to disk. Our analysis
showed that the revealed firmware modules were based on a known bootkit named Vector-
EDK, and the dropped malware is a downloader for further components. By pivoting on
unique traits of the malware, we uncovered a range of similar samples from our telemetry
that have been used against diplomatic targets since 2017 and have different infection
vectors. While the business logic of most is identical, we could see that some had additional
features or differed in implementation. Due to this, we infer that the bulk of samples
originate from a bigger framework that we have dubbed <MALWARE>MosaicRegressor</MALWARE>. Code artefacts in
some of the framework’s components, and overlaps in C2 infrastructure used during the
campaign, suggest that a Chinese-speaking actor is behind these attacks, possibly one that
has connections to groups using the <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> backdoor. The targets, diplomatic institutions
and NGOs in <GEO>Asia</GEO>, <GEO>Europe</GEO> and <GEO>Africa</GEO>, all appear to be connected in some way to <GEO>North
Korea</GEO>.
<GEO>Europe</GEO>
Since publishing our initial report on <MALWARE>WellMess</MALWARE> (see our APT trends report Q2 2020), the
<ORG>UK National Cyber Security Centre</ORG> (<ORG>NCSC</ORG>) has released a joint technical advisory, along with
Canadian and US governments, on the most recent activity involving <MALWARE>WellMess</MALWARE>. Specifically,
all three governments attribute the use of this malware targeting COVID-19 vaccine research
to <THREAT_ACTOR>The Dukes</THREAT_ACTOR> (aka <THREAT_ACTOR>APT29</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>Cozy Bear</THREAT_ACTOR>). The advisory also details two other pieces of
malware, <MALWARE>SOREFANG</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>WellMail</MALWARE>, that were used during this activity. Given the direct
public statement on attribution, new details provided in the advisory, as well as new
information discovered since our initial investigation, we published our report to serve as a
supplement to our previous reporting on this threat actor. While the publication of the <ORG>NCSC</ORG>
advisory has increased general public awareness on the malware used in these recent attacks,
the attribution statements made by all three governments provided no clear evidence for
other researchers to pivot on for confirmation. For this reason, we are currently unable to
modify our original statement; and we still assess that the <MALWARE>WellMess</MALWARE> activity has been
conducted by a previously unknown threat actor. We will continue to monitor for new
activity and adjust this statement in the future if new evidence is uncovered.

Russian-speaking activity
In summer, we uncovered a previously unknown multimodule C++ toolset used in highly
targeted industrial espionage attacks dating back to 2018. So far, we have seen no similarities
with known malicious activity regarding code, infrastructure or TTPs. To date, we consider
this toolset and the actor behind it to be new. The malware authors named the toolset <MALWARE>MT3</MALWARE>,
and based on this abbreviation we have named the toolset <MALWARE>MontysThree</MALWARE>. The malware is
configured to search for specific document types, including those stored on removable
media. It contains natural language artefacts of correct Russian and a configuration that seek
directories that exist only in Cyrilic version of Windows, while presenting some false flag
artefacts suggesting a Chinese-speaking origin. The malware uses legitimate cloud services
such as <ORG>Google</ORG>, <ORG>Microsoft</ORG> and Dropbox for C2 communications.
Chinese-speaking activity
Earlier this year, we discovered an active and previously unknown stealthy implant dubbed
<MALWARE>Moriya</MALWARE> in the networks of regional inter-governmental organizations in <GEO>Asia</GEO> and <GEO>Africa</GEO>. This
tool was used to control public facing servers in those organizations by establishing a covert
channel with a C2 server and passing shell commands and their outputs to the C2. This
capability is facilitated using a Windows kernel mode driver. Use of the tool is part of an
ongoing campaign that we have named <MALWARE>TunnelSnake</MALWARE>. The rootkit was detected on the
targeted machines in May, with activity dating back as early as November 2019, persisting in
networks for several months following the initial infection. We found another tool showing
significant code overlaps with this rootkit, suggesting that the developers have been active
since at least 2018. Since neither rootkit nor other lateral movement tools that accompanied
it during the campaign relied on hard-coded C2 servers, we could gain only partial visibility
into the attacker’s infrastructure. That said, the bulk of detected tools, apart from <MALWARE>Moriya</MALWARE>,
consisted of both proprietary and well-known pieces of malware that were previously used by
Chinese-speaking threat actors, giving a clue to the attacker’s origin.
<MALWARE>PlugX</MALWARE> continues to be effectively and heavily used across <GEO>Southeast and East Asia</GEO>, and also
<GEO>Africa</GEO>, with some minimal use in <GEO>Europe</GEO>. The <MALWARE>PlugX</MALWARE> codebase has been in use by multiple
Chinese-speaking <THREAT_ACTOR>APT</THREAT_ACTOR> groups, including <MALWARE>HoneyMyte</MALWARE>, <MALWARE>Cycldek</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>LuckyMouse</MALWARE>.
Government agencies, NGOs and IT service organizations seem to be consistent targets.
While the new USB spreading capability is opportunistically pushing the malware
throughout networks, compromised MSSPs/IT service organizations appear to be a potential
vector of targeted delivery, with <MALWARE>CobaltStrike</MALWARE> installer packages pushed to multiple systems
for initial <MALWARE>PlugX</MALWARE> installation. Based on our visibility, the majority of activity in the last
quarter appears to be in <GEO>Mongolia</GEO>, <GEO>Vietnam</GEO> and <GEO>Myanmar</GEO>. The number of systems in these
countries dealing with PlugX in 2020 is at the very least in the thousands.

11/4/2020 APT trends report Q3 2020 | Securelist
We discovered an ongoing campaign, dating back to May, utilizing a new version of the
<MALWARE>Okrum</MALWARE> backdoor, attributed to <THREAT_ACTOR>Ke3chang</THREAT_ACTOR>. This updated version of <MALWARE>Okrum</MALWARE> uses an
Authenticode-signed Windows Defender binary using a unique side-loading technique. The
attackers used steganography to conceal the main payload in the Defender executable while
keeping its digital signature valid, reducing the chance of detection. We haven’t previously
seen this method being used in the wild for malicious purposes. We have observed one
affected victim, a <INDUSTRY>telecoms</INDUSTRY> company located in <GEO>Europe</GEO>.
On September 16, the <ORG>US Department of Justice</ORG> released three indictments associated with
hackers allegedly connected with <THREAT_ACTOR>APT41</THREAT_ACTOR> and other intrusion sets tracked as <MALWARE>Barium</MALWARE>, <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE>,
<MALWARE>Wicked Panda</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>Wicked Spider</MALWARE>. In addition, two Malaysian nationals were also arrested
on September 14, in <GEO>Sitiawan</GEO> (<GEO>Malaysia</GEO>), for “conspiring to profit from computer intrusions
targeting the video game industry”, following cooperation between the <ORG>US DoJ</ORG> and the
<ORG>Malaysian government</ORG>, including the <ORG>Attorney General’s Chambers of Malaysia</ORG> and the
<ORG>Royal Malaysia Police</ORG>. The first indictment alleges that the defendants set up an elite “white
hat” network security company, called <ORG>Chengdu 404 Network Technology Co, Ltd.</ORG> (aka
<ORG>Chengdu Si Lingsi Network Technology Co., Ltd.</ORG>), and under its guise, engaged in computer
intrusions targeting hundreds of companies around the world. According to the indictment,
they “carried out their hacking using specialized malware, such as malware that cyber-
security experts named ‘<MALWARE>PlugX/Fast</MALWARE>’, ‘<MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE>/Pasteboy’, ‘<MALWARE>Shadowpad</MALWARE>’, ‘<MALWARE>Barlaiy</MALWARE>/<MALWARE>Poison Plug</MALWARE>’
and ‘<MALWARE>Crosswalk/ProxIP</MALWARE>'”. The indictments contain several indirect IoCs, which allowed us to
connect these intrusions to Operation <MALWARE>ShadowPad</MALWARE> and Operation <THREAT_ACTOR>ShadowHammer</THREAT_ACTOR>, two
massive supply-chain attacks discovered and investigated by <ORG>Kaspersky</ORG> in recent years.
<GEO>Middle East</GEO>
In June, we observed new activity by the <THREAT_ACTOR>MuddyWater</THREAT_ACTOR> APT group, involving use of a new set
of tools that constitute a multistage framework for loading malware modules. Some
components of the framework leverage code to communicate with C2s identical to code we
observed in the <MALWARE>MoriAgent</MALWARE> malware earlier this year. For this reason, we decided to dub the
new framework <MALWARE>MementoMori</MALWARE>. The purpose of the new framework is to facilitate execution
of further in-memory PowerShell or DLL modules. We detected high-profile victims based in
<GEO>Turkey</GEO>, <GEO>Egypt</GEO> and <GEO>Azerbaijan</GEO>.
<GEO>Southeast Asia</GEO> and <GEO>Korean Peninsula</GEO>
In May, we found new samples belonging to the <MALWARE>Dtrack</MALWARE> family. The first sample, named
<MALWARE>Valefor</MALWARE>, is an updated version of the <MALWARE>Dtrack RAT</MALWARE> containing a new feature enabling the
attacker to execute more types of payload. The second sample is a keylogger called <MALWARE>Camio</MALWARE>
which is an updated version of its keylogger. This new version updates the logged

information and its storage mechanism. We observed signs indicating that these malware
programs were tailored for specific victims. At the time of our research our telemetry
revealed victims located in Japan.
We have been tracking <MALWARE>LODEINFO</MALWARE>, fileless malware used in targeted attacks since last
December. During this time, we observed several versions as the authors were developing the
malware. In May, we detected version v0.3.6 targeting diplomatic organizations located in
Japan. Shortly after that, we detected v0.3.8 as well. Our investigation revealed how the
attackers operate during the lateral movement stage: after obtaining the desired data, the
attackers wipe their traces. Our private report included a technical analysis of the
<MALWARE>LODEINFO</MALWARE> malware and the attack sequence in the victim’s network, to disclose the actor’s
tactics and methods.
While tracking <THREAT_ACTOR>Transparent Tribe</THREAT_ACTOR> activity, we discovered an interesting tool used by this APT
threat actor: the server component used to manage <MALWARE>CrimsonRAT</MALWARE> bots. We found different
versions of this software, allowing us to look at the malware from the perspective of the
attackers. It shows that the main purpose of this tool is file stealing, given its functionalities
for exploring the remote file system and collecting files using specific filters. <THREAT_ACTOR>Transparent
Tribe</THREAT_ACTOR> (aka <THREAT_ACTOR>PROJECTM</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>MYTHIC LEOPARD</THREAT_ACTOR>) is a very prolific APT group that has
increased its activities in recent months. We reported the launch of a new wide-ranging
campaign that uses the <MALWARE>CrimsonRAT</MALWARE> tool where we were able to set up and analyze the server
component and saw the use of the USBWorm component for the first time; we also found an
Android implant used to target military personnel in India. This discovery also confirms
much of the information already discovered during previous investigations; and it also
confirms that <MALWARE>CrimsonRAT</MALWARE> is still under active development.
In April, we discovered a new malware strain that we named <MALWARE>CRAT</MALWARE>, based on the build path
and internal file name. The malware was spread using a weaponized Hangul document as
well as a Trojanized application and strategic web compromise. Since its discovery the full-
featured backdoor has quickly evolved, diversifying into several components. A downloader
delivers <MALWARE>CRAT</MALWARE> to profile victims, followed by next-stage orchestrator malware named
<MALWARE>SecondCrat</MALWARE>: this orchestrator loads various plugins for espionage, including keylogging,
screen capturing and clipboard stealing. During our investigation, we found several weak
connections with <THREAT_ACTOR>ScarCruft</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR>: we discovered that several debugging messages
inside the malware have similar patterns to <THREAT_ACTOR>ScarCruft</THREAT_ACTOR> malware, as well as some code patterns
and the naming of the <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> C2 infrastructure.
In June, we observed a new set of malicious Android downloaders which, according to our
telemetry, have been actively used in the wild since at least December 2019; and have been
used in a campaign targeting victims almost exclusively in Pakistan. Its authors used the
Kotlin programming language and Firebase messaging system for the downloader, which
mimics Chat Lite, <ORG>Kashmir News Service</ORG> and other legitimate regional Android applications.
A report by <ORG>the</ORG> <ORG>National Telecom & Information Technology Security Board</ORG> (<ORG>NTISB</ORG>) from
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2020/99204/ 5/8

11/4/2020 APT trends report Q3 2020 | Securelist
January describes malware sharing the same C2s and spoofing the same legitimate apps.
According to this publication, targets were <ORG>Pakistani military bodies</ORG>, and the attackers used
WhatsApp messages, SMS, emails and social media as the initial infection vectors. Our own
telemetry shows that this malware also spreads through Telegram messenger. The analysis of
the initial set of downloaders allowed us to find an additional set of Trojans that we believe
are strongly related, as they use the package name mentioned in the downloaders and focus
on the same targets. These new samples have strong code similarity with artefacts previously
attributed to <THREAT_ACTOR>Origami Elephant</THREAT_ACTOR>.
In mid-July, we observed a <ORG>Southeast Asian government organization</ORG> targeted by an
unknown threat actor with a malicious ZIP package containing a multilayered malicious RAR
executable package. In one of the incidents, the package was themed around COVID-19
containment. We believe that the same organization was probably the same target of a
government web server watering-hole, compromised in early July and serving a highly
similar malicious LNK. Much like other campaigns against particular countries that we have
seen in the past, these adversaries are taking a long-term, multipronged approach to
compromising target systems without utilizing zero-day exploits. Notably, another group
(probably <THREAT_ACTOR>OceanLotus</THREAT_ACTOR>) used a similar Telegram delivery technique with its malware implants
against the same government targets within a month or so of the COVID-19-themed
malicious LNK, in addition to its use of <MALWARE>Cobalt Strike</MALWARE>.
In May 2020, <ORG>Kaspersky</ORG> technologies prevented an attack using a malicious script for
Internet Explorer against a South Korean company. Closer analysis revealed that the attack
used a previously unknown full chain that consisted of two zero-day exploits: a Remote Code
Execution exploit for Internet Explorer and an Elevation of Privilege exploit for Windows.
Unlike a previous full chain that we discovered, used in <CAMPAIGN>Operation WizardOpium</CAMPAIGN> (you can
read more here and here), the new full chain targeted the latest builds of Windows 10, and
our tests demonstrated reliable exploitation of Internet Explorer 11 and Windows 10 build
18363 x64. On June 8, we reported our discoveries to <ORG>Microsoft</ORG>, who confirmed the
vulnerabilities. At the time of our report, the security team at <ORG>Microsoft</ORG> had already prepared
a patch for vulnerability CVE-2020-0986 that was used in the zero-day Elevation of Privilege
exploit; but before our discovery, the exploitability of this vulnerability had been considered
less likely. The patch for CVE-2020-0986 was released on June 9. Microsoft assigned CVE-
2020-1380 to a use-after-free vulnerability in JScript and the patch for this was released on
August 11. We are calling this and related attacks <CAMPAIGN>Operation PowerFall</CAMPAIGN>. Currently, we are
unable to establish a definitive link with any known threat actor, but due to similarities with
previously discovered exploits we believe that <THREAT_ACTOR>DarkHotel</THREAT_ACTOR> may be behind this attack.
On July 22, we came across a suspicious archive file that was uploaded to VirusTotal from an
Italian source. The file seemed to be a triage consisting of malicious scripts, access logs,
malicious document files and several screenshots related to suspicious file detections from
security solutions. After looking into these malicious document files, we identified that they
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2020/99204/ 6/8

11/4/2020 APT trends report Q3 2020 | Securelist
are related to a <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> group campaign that we reported in June. This campaign, dubbed
<CAMPAIGN>DeathNote</CAMPAIGN>, targeted the automobile industry and individuals in the academic field using lure
documents containing aerospace and defense-related job descriptions. We are confident that
these documents are related to a recently reported attack on an Israeli defense company. We
have uncovered webshell scripts, C2 server scripts and malicious documents, identified
several victims connected to the compromised C2 server, as well as uncovering the method
used to access the C2 server.
We have observed an ongoing <THREAT_ACTOR>Sidewinder</THREAT_ACTOR> campaign that started in February, using five
different malware types. The group made changes to its final payloads and continues to
target government, diplomatic and military entities using current themes, such as COVID-19,
in its spear-phishing efforts. While the infection mechanism remains the same as before,
including the group’s exploit of choice (CVE-2017-1182) and use of the DotNetToJScript tool
to deploy the final payloads, we found that the actor also used ZIP archives containing a
Microsoft compiled HTML Help file to download the last-stage payload. In addition to the
existing .NET-based implant, which we call SystemApp, the threat actor added JS
Orchestrator, the <MALWARE>Rover/Scout</MALWARE> backdoor and modified versions of <MALWARE>AsyncRAT</MALWARE>, <MALWARE>warzoneRAT</MALWARE>
to its arsenal.
Other interesting discoveries
Attribution is difficult at the best of times, and sometimes it’s not possible at all. While
investigating an ongoing campaign, we discovered a new Android implant undergoing
development, with no clear link to any previously known Android malware. The malware is
able to monitor and steal call logs, SMS, audio, video and non-media files, as well as
identifying information about the infected device. It also implements an interesting feature
to collect information on network routes and topology obtained using the “traceroute”
command as well as using local ARP caches. During this investigation we uncovered a cluster
of similar Android infostealer implants, with one example being obfuscated. We also found
older Android malware that more closely resembles a backdoor, with traces of it in the wild
dating back to August 2019.
In April, <ORG>Cisco</ORG> Talos described the activities of an unknown actor targeting <ORG>Azerbaijan</ORG>’s
government and <INDUSTRY>energy</INDUSTRY> sector using new malware called <MALWARE>PoetRAT</MALWARE>. In collaboration with
<ORG>Kaspersky ICS CERT</ORG>, we identified supplementary samples of associated malware and
documents with broader targeting of multiple universities, government and industrial
organizations as well as entities in the energy sector in <GEO>Azerbaijan</GEO>. The campaign started in
early November 2019; and the attackers switched off the infrastructure immediately
following publication of the <ORG>Cisco Talos</ORG> report. Since then, no new related documents or
<MALWARE>PoetRAT</MALWARE> samples have been discovered. We observed a small overlap in victimology with
https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2020/99204/ 7/8

11/4/2020 APT trends report Q3 2020 | Securelist
<THREAT_ACTOR>Turla</THREAT_ACTOR>, but since there is no technically sound proof of relation between them, and we haven’t
been able to attribute this new set of activity to any other previously known actor, we named
it <THREAT_ACTOR>Obsidian Gargoyle</THREAT_ACTOR>.
Final thoughts
The TTPs of some threat actors remain fairly consistent over time (such as using hot topics
such (COVID-19) to entice users to download and execute malicious attachments sent in
spear-phishing emails), while other groups reinvent themselves, developing new toolsets and
widening their scope of activities, for example, to include new platforms. And while some
threat actors develop very sophisticated tools, for example, <MALWARE>MosiacRegressor</MALWARE> UEFI implant,
others have great success with basic TTPs. Our regular quarterly reviews are intended to
highlight the key developments of APT groups.
Here are the main trends that we’ve seen in Q3 2020:
Geo-politics continues to drive the development of many APT campaigns, as seen in
recent months in the activities of <THREAT_ACTOR>Transparent Tribe</THREAT_ACTOR>, <THREAT_ACTOR>Sidewinder</THREAT_ACTOR>, <THREAT_ACTOR>Origami Elephant</THREAT_ACTOR> and
<THREAT_ACTOR>MosaicRegressor</THREAT_ACTOR>, and in the ‘naming and shaming’ of various threat actors by the
<ORG>NCSC</ORG> and the <ORG>US Department of Justice</ORG>.
Organizations in the <INDUSTRY>financial sector</INDUSTRY> also continue to attract attention: the activities of
the mercenary group <THREAT_ACTOR>DeathStalker</THREAT_ACTOR> is a recent example.
We continue to observe the use of mobile implants in APT attacks with recent examples
including <THREAT_ACTOR>Transparent Tribe</THREAT_ACTOR> and <THREAT_ACTOR>Origami Elephant</THREAT_ACTOR>.
While APT threat actors remain active across the globe, recent hotspots of activity have
been Southeast Asia, the Middle East and various regions affected by the activities of
Chinese-speaking APT groups.
Unsurprisingly, we continue to see COVID-19-themed attacks – this quarter they
included <MALWARE>WellMess</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>Sidewinder</MALWARE>.
Among the most interesting APT campaigns this quarter were <CAMPAIGN>DeathStalker</CAMPAIGN> and
<CAMPAIGN>MosaicRegressor</CAMPAIGN>: the former underlining the fact that APT groups can achieve their
aims without developing highly sophisticated tools; the latter representing the leading-
edge in malware development.
As always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat
landscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually improve,
there is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our radar.
