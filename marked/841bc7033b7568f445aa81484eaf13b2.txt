As the world braces for a pandemic-ridden winter, COVID-19 appears to be losing steam at

throughout all H1. In Q3, RDP attack attempts climbed by a further 37% in terms of unique

One of the chips we looked at, aside from those from
<ORG>Broadcom</ORG> and <ORG>Cypress</ORG>, was by <ORG>Qualcomm</ORG>. The vulnerabili-
ty we discovered (which was assigned CVE-2020-3702) was
also triggerable by a disassociation and led to undesirable
disclosure of data by transmitting unencrypted data in
the place of encrypted data frames — much like with KrØØk.
The main difference is, however, that instead of being
encrypted with an all-zero session key, the data is not
encrypted at all.
The screenshot shows a Wireshark log of a frame captured
after a disassociation was invoked on a Wi-Fi router fit-
ted with a <ORG>Qualcomm</ORG> chip. Notice that the Protected flag
within the Frame Control Field is set to TRUE and the
frame appears to have CCMP parameters — both indicators
of an encrypted data frame. But the data was transmitted
unencrypted.
The devices we tested and found to have been vulnerable
are the D-Link DCH-G020 Smart Home Hub and the Turris
Omnia wireless router. Of course, any other unpatched de-
vices using the vulnerable <ORG>Qualcomm</ORG> chipsets will also be
vulnerable.

<MALWARE>Evilnum</MALWARE> malware, used in attacks against financial technology companies. While the
malware has been in the wild since at least 2018, the group’s activities have remained
largely under the radar.
The research reveals that the group’s toolset and infrastructure have evolved,
consisting of a mix of custom, homemade malware combined with tools purchased from

Other detection types in the rankings mostly held their positions, albeit with a notably
lower share. The proportion of DOC detections declined from 21% in Q2 to less than 10% in
Q3. A similar pattern was observed in the case of JS detections, which went down from 13%

Finally, VBS downloaders went down from 8% to less than 5%.
The main driver behind the massive increase of VBA detections was <MALWARE>Emotet</MALWARE> and its
renewed activity in Q3. This notorious malware strain went quiet early in the year, only to
return in the last days of July after a five-month break. The connection between <MALWARE>Emote</MALWARE>t

Android threats
While ad-displaying apps continued to dominate the Android threat scene, banking malware detections saw an upswing in Q3 2020.
After a peak in May 2020, Android detections declined in June, rose in July and kept a
relatively steady level throughout August and September. In terms of overall volume of
detections, Q3 saw a 19% decline in comparison with the previous quarter.
The increase in July was connected to growth of the Hidden Apps threat category, which
has dominated the Android threat landscape for three consecutive quarters. This category
covers detections of deceptive apps that hide their icons after installation and flood the
affected device with full-screen ads. They are commonly disguised as attractive games
and various useful utilities.
<MALWARE>Android/HiddenApp</MALWARE> detections have doubled compared to Q2, and tripled their share in the
top 10 ranking. The <MALWARE>Android/Hiddad</MALWARE> family rose from second place to first, although its

<MALWARE>Cerberus</MALWARE> is a notorious mobile banking trojan that surfaced [60] in June 2019 and was
highly active until July 2020, when the gang behind the malware split up and put the mal-
ware up for auction [61]. Not even a month later, on August 11, the <MALWARE>Cerberus</MALWARE> source code
was released for free [62] on an underground forum, allowing anyone to use the malware
for their own profit — thus boosting the number of detected attack attempts.

Top malicious email attachment types2 in Q3 2020
More than 70% of the malicious attachments identified in Q3 2020 were executables,
followed by script files and Office documents. Compared to Q2, executables strengthened
their first-place position with an increase of 18 percentage points; Office files decreased Spam email using COVID-19 financial assistance as a lure
by 13 points.
Executable attachments were frequently disguised using so-called double file extensions
to trick recipients into opening them, taking advantage of the fact that file extensions
for known file types are hidden by default on Windows. PDF was by far the most heavily
used guise in Q3; attackers also commonly attempted to disguise malicious executables as
Microsoft Excel and Word files, images and archives.
As for detections of spam — unsolicited emails of any kind, not necessarily carrying
malware — these kept a steady level in Q3, with multiple small peaks. The overall volume of
spam detected was up by 4% compared to the previous quarter.
In Q3, we observed spammers still frequently misusing the coronavirus pandemic for their

Upcoming presentations
CODE BLUE 2020
KrØØk: Serious vulnerability affected encryption of a billion+ Wi-Fi devices
For those who didn’t have a chance to see this talk at any of the previous virtual
events, <ORG>ESET</ORG> malware researcher <IDENTITY>Robert Lipovský</IDENTITY> will disclose the details of the
security flaw KrØØk at CODE BLUE 2020. His talk will offer information about the
original research that found the vulnerability in <ORG>Broadcom</ORG> and <ORG>Cypress</ORG> Wi-Fi chips,
and will also add findings from the follow-up research.
ESET RESEARCH <ORG>Botconf</ORG>
The <THREAT_ACTOR>Winnti Group</THREAT_ACTOR>: An analysis of their latest activities
At this year’s online edition of <ORG>Botconf</ORG>, <ORG>ESET</ORG> malware researcher <IDENTITY>Mathieu Tartare</IDENTITY>
will provide an overview of the latest activities of the <THREAT_ACTOR>Winnti Group</THREAT_ACTOR>, responsible for
high-profile supply-chain attacks against the video game and software industries,
CONTRIBUTIONS
as well as the <INDUSTRY>healthcare</INDUSTRY> and <INDUSTRY>education</INDUSTRY> sector. The presentation will show that not
only is the <THREAT_ACTOR>Winnti Group</THREAT_ACTOR> still actively using and maintaining its flagship backdoor
<MALWARE>ShadowPad</MALWARE> along with the <MALWARE>Winnti</MALWARE> malware family, but also that they extended their
arsenal with new tools and some new and undocumented implants.
<THREAT_ACTOR>Turla</THREAT_ACTOR> operations from a front row seat
In his <ORG>Botconf</ORG> presentation, <ORG>ESET</ORG> malware researcher <IDENTITY>Matthieu Faou</IDENTITY> will share fresh
information about the TTPs of <THREAT_ACTOR>Turla</THREAT_ACTOR>, an advanced threat group tracked by <ORG>ESET</ORG> for
several years. These actors are mainly interested in high-profile targets such as
government bodies and defense companies. The presentation will describe the main
attacks publicly attributed to the group and explore the attackers’ motives. The
technical part of the talk will showcase <THREAT_ACTOR>Turla</THREAT_ACTOR>’s implementation of the three classic
steps of an APT campaign: compromise, lateral movement, and long-term persistence.
