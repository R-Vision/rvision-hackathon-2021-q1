The <ORG>“</ORG><ORG>Tick</ORG>” group has conducted cyber espionage attacks against organizations in the
Republic of <GEO>Korea</GEO> and <GEO>Japan</GEO> for several years. The group focuses on companies that have
intellectual property or sensitive information like those in the <INDUSTRY>Defense</INDUSTRY> and <INDUSTRY>High</INDUSTRY>-<INDUSTRY>Tech</INDUSTRY>
industries. The group is known to use custom malware called <MALWARE>Daserf</MALWARE>, but also employs
multiple commodity and custom tools, exploit vulnerabilities, and use social engineering
techniques.
Regarding the command and control (C2) infrastructure, <THREAT_ACTOR>Tick</THREAT_ACTOR> previously used domains
registered through privacy protection services to keep their anonymity, but have moved to
compromised websites in recent attacks. With multiple tools and anonymous infrastructure,
they are running longstanding and persistent attack campaigns. We have observed that the
adversary has repeatedly attacked a high-proﬁle target in Japan using multiple malware
families for the last three years.
<THREAT_ACTOR>Tick</THREAT_ACTOR> Tools
<ORG>Symantec</ORG> was ﬁrst to publicly report on <THREAT_ACTOR>Tick</THREAT_ACTOR>, followed by<MALWARE>LAC</MALWARE> in 2016. These reports
discussed the group’s malware, <MALWARE>Daserf</MALWARE> (a.k.a <MALWARE>Muirim</MALWARE> or <MALWARE>Nioupale</MALWARE>) and some additional
downloader programs. Though <MALWARE>Daserf</MALWARE> wasn’t a popular attack tool at the time of publishing
the two reports, it dates back to at least 2011. Using AutoFocus, we were able to identify the
link among <MALWARE>Daserf</MALWARE> and two other threats, 9002 and <MALWARE>Invader</MALWARE>. These threats shared
infrastructure between July 2012 and April 2013.
Figure 1 Sharing C2 servers among threats
<MALWARE>Invader</MALWARE> (a.k.a <MALWARE>Kickesgo</MALWARE>) is a backdoor that injects its main code into a legitimate process,
such as explorer.exe, and has following functions:

Logs keystrokes and mouse movement
Captures screenshots
Opens cmd.exe shell
Enumerates processes
Executes programs
Removes itself
Enumerates all opening TCP and UDP ports
9002 is the infamous RAT frequently seen in targeted attacks reported by various security
vendors, including <ORG>Palo Alto Networks</ORG>. Interestingly, the C2 servers linking 9002 to <MALWARE>Daserf</MALWARE>
were described in the report of an Adobe Flash Zero-day attack from <ORG>FireEye</ORG> in 2013. These
domains were registered through the privacy protection services in 2008 and 2011.

lywja.healthsvsolu[.]com
Though we don’t know the targets of these malware samples at the time of writing this article,
we suspect the same group is behind these threats for a number of reasons. The samples of
<MALWARE>Daserf</MALWARE> that shared infrastructure were submitted to VirusTotal only from <GEO>Japan</GEO> multiple times
in 2013. As noted in a later section, another <MALWARE>Invader</MALWARE> sample shared diﬀerent C2 servers with
<MALWARE>Daserf</MALWARE>. <ORG>Symantec</ORG> reported that <THREAT_ACTOR>Tick</THREAT_ACTOR> exploited additional Adobe Flash and <ORG>Microsoft</ORG> Oﬃce
vulnerabilities. <ORG>SecureWorks</ORG> said the adversary group is abusing a previously undisclosed
vulnerability in Japanese Software Asset Management system on endpoints. Therefore, <THREAT_ACTOR>Tick</THREAT_ACTOR>
or their digital quartermaster is capable of deploying new and unique exploits.
<MALWARE>Minzen</MALWARE> and <MALWARE>Nameless Backdoor</MALWARE>
In July 2016, we identiﬁed a compromised website in Japan that was hosting a <MALWARE>Daserf</MALWARE> variant.
The web server was also a C2 server for another threat, <MALWARE>Minzen</MALWARE> (a.k.a, <MALWARE>XXMM</MALWARE>, <MALWARE>Wali</MALWARE>, or
<MALWARE>ShadowWali</MALWARE>). The threat often uses compromised web servers in <GEO>Japan</GEO> and the <GEO>Republic of
Korea</GEO>.
As <ORG>Kaspersky</ORG> and Cybereason recently posted, <MALWARE>Minzen</MALWARE> is a modular malware that has both
32-bit and 64-bit components in its resource section or conﬁguration data in its body. One of
the <MALWARE>Minzen</MALWARE> samples (SHA256:
9374040a9e2f47f7037edaac19f21ﬀ1ef6a999ﬀ98c306504f89a37196074a2) found in the
<GEO>Republic of Korea</GEO> in December 2016 installs simple backdoor module as a ﬁnal payload on a
compromised computer. It opens a TCP port and receives commands from a remote attacker.
According to the debug path in the body, the author of the tool called it “<MALWARE>NamelessHdoor</MALWARE>,”
and its internal version is identiﬁed as “V1.5.”
Figure 2 Debug path left in the backdoor module in <MALWARE>Minzen</MALWARE>
The payload is based on “<MALWARE>Nameless Backdoor</MALWARE>” which has been publicly available for more
than ten years. The oldest code we could identify was hosted on a famous Chinese source
code sharing site since 2005. The author of the <MALWARE>NamelessHdoor</MALWARE> appears to have created
additional versions of the <MALWARE>Nameless Backdoor</MALWARE> by removing unnecessary functions, and
added open-source DLL injection code from ReﬂectiveDLLLoader.

Figure 3 <MALWARE>Nameless Backdoor</MALWARE> posted on Chinese Source File Sharing Site
There is minimal public information regarding the <MALWARE>Nameless Backdoor</MALWARE>, except for the
interesting report from <ORG>Cyphort</ORG> in 2015. The researcher of the company analyzed multiple
threats, including <MALWARE>Invader</MALWARE>, <MALWARE>Nioupale</MALWARE>(<MALWARE>Daserf</MALWARE>) and <MALWARE>Hdoor</MALWARE> found in an attack against an Asian
ﬁnancial institution. We examined the sample described in the report as <MALWARE>Hdoor</MALWARE> and found it’s
a previous version of the <MALWARE>NamelessHdoor</MALWARE> we discovered in the <MALWARE>Minzen</MALWARE> sample, but without
support for DLL injection.
Figure 4 Strings in NamelessHdoor sample found in 2015
Shared Infrastructure and Cipher Code with Custom <MALWARE>Gh0st</MALWARE>
Other interesting samples in the report are dllhost.exe and Shell64.dll. We don’t have the
same ﬁles but found possible variants close to their description in the article. These include
the following:
Executable ﬁles that connect to the same remote server, blog.softﬁx.co[.]kr:80,
download a DLL ﬁle and execute the ‘lowmain’ export function.
DLL ﬁles have ‘lowmain’ and ‘main’ exports.
It turned out that the DLL ﬁles we found are a custom variant of <MALWARE>Gh0st RAT</MALWARE>, and the EXE ﬁles
download the RAT. Since the source code is publicly available, <MALWARE>Gh0st RAT</MALWARE> has been used by

multiple actors for years.
The domain, softﬁx.co[.]kr was registered in 2014. One of subdomains, news.softﬁx.co[.]kr
was the C2 server of Daserf (SHA256:
9c7a34390e92d4551c26a3feb5b181757b3309995acd1f92e0f63f888aa89423). Another
subdomain, bbs.softﬁx.co[.]kr was hosted on same IP address as bbs.gokickes[.]com, which
was reported as the C2 server of <MALWARE>Invader</MALWARE> by <IDENTITY>Cyphort</IDENTITY>. We also identiﬁed www.gokickes[.]com
was the C2 of another <MALWARE>Invader</MALWARE> variant (SHA256:
57e1d3122e6dc88d9eb2989f081de88a0e6864e767281d509ﬀ58834928895fb).
In addition to the infrastructure, the attacker also shared code. The <MALWARE>Gh0st</MALWARE> downloaders
employ simple substitution ciphers for hiding strings.
Figure 5 Decryption code in <MALWARE>Gh0st</MALWARE> Downloader
The cipher converts one character to another based on a substitution table, which can be
seen below. As an example, the character ‘K’ in plain text is changed to ‘5’ in cipher text, ‘h’
is converted to ‘j’ and so on. The string ‘connect’ was encoded to ‘zF((0za’ using this table.

The exact same table for simple substitution cipher is used in a variant of Daserf (SHA256:
01d681c51ad0c7c3d4b320973c61c28a353624ac665fd390553b364d17911f46). We also
found a very similar table in other <THREAT_ACTOR>Tick</THREAT_ACTOR> tools. Since the strings are unique to these threats, we

believe a developer linked to the group built these tools. Because of the shared domains and
code, we believe the incident reported by <ORG>Cyphort</ORG> have ties to <THREAT_ACTOR>Tick</THREAT_ACTOR>. The following tables were
identiﬁed for their associated malware samples:

Spearphishing Email with Patched File Encryption Program
We also identiﬁed another malware family, <MALWARE>HomamDownloader</MALWARE>, sharing some servers with
<MALWARE>Daserf</MALWARE>. An overview of the connections among these threats is discussed in below.
Figure 6 Links among threats and servers
<MALWARE>HomamDownloader</MALWARE> is a small downloader program with minimal interesting characteristics
from a technical point of view. <MALWARE>HomamDownloader</MALWARE> was discovered to be delivered by <THREAT_ACTOR>Tick</THREAT_ACTOR> via
a spearphishing email. The adversary crafted credible email and attachment after
understanding the targets and their behavior.
The email below was sent from a personal email account with a subject line of “New Year

Wishes on January 1st”. The message asked the recipient to rename the attachment
extension from “._X_” to “.exe” and opening it with the password speciﬁed in the email to
view the Happy New Year eCard in the correct and polite language.
Figure 7 Spearphishing Email with <MALWARE>HomamDownloader</MALWARE>
The image above is translated to the following in English:
Dear XXXX,
Heartfelt Greetings for the New Year.
Thank you very much for your support over the past year.
I will greatly appreciate your further guidance and encouragement.
Would you please change the ﬁle extension of the attachment from “._X_” to “.exe” and open
it?
Password is “nengajyo”.
For those who are not familiar with Japanese companies, the email must look suspicious,
especially given that the executable ﬁle attachment has the incorrect ﬁle extension. However,
this may look legitimate in some cases. Many Japanese companies introduced a ﬁle
encryption system for secure data exchange over email. The system encrypts documents
with a user-speciﬁed password and often creates a self-extracting (SFX) ﬁle for ease of
decrypting the ﬁle to recipients. When sending the SFX ﬁle with a password by email, senders

usually rename the ﬁle extension from .exe to something else to avoid blocking or detecting
the attachment by an email gateway or security product. The adversary may know Japanese
enterprise users exchange these emails in such a way and crafts the spearphishing email in
the same manner.
In addition to the social engineering email technique, the attacker also employs a trick to the
attachment. The actor embedded malicious code to a resource section of the legitimate SFX
ﬁle created by a ﬁle encryption tool, and modiﬁed the entry point of the program for jumping
to the malicious code soon after the SFX program starts. The malicious code drops
<MALWARE>HomamDownloader</MALWARE>, then jumps back to the regular ﬂow in the CODE section, which in turn
asks the user the password and decrypts the ﬁle. Therefore, once a user executes the
attachment and sees the password dialog on SFX, the downloader dropped by the malicious
code starts working even if the user chooses the Cancel on the password window. Should the
user become aware of the infection later, it may be diﬃcult to ﬁnd the cause due to the fact
that the original embedded ﬁle contained within the SFX is benign.

Conclusion
<THREAT_ACTOR>Tick</THREAT_ACTOR> was spotted last year, but they are actively and silently attacking various organizations in
<GEO>South Korea</GEO> and <GEO>Japan</GEO> for a number of years. While some of the group’s tools, tactics, and
procedures (TTPs) have been covered within this article, it is likely there is much that still
remains uncovered.
