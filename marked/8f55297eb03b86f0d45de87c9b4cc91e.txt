1. Summary
<ORG>SWIFT</ORG> plays a key role in helping its community to reinforce and safeguard the integrity of the global
financial ecosystem, and maintains a relentless focus on security. As part of that focus, SWIFT has an ongoing
commitment to intelligence sharing and thought leadership that contribute to the community’s understanding
of the cyber threat and tactics of cyber criminals. One area where the community has expressed interest in
gaining more insight is around the approaches cyber criminals use to extract money once they have executed a
successful attack. With this in mind, <ORG>SWIFT</ORG> commissioned <ORG>BAE Systems</ORG> to research and write this report. Its aim
is to illuminate the tactics and techniques used by cyber criminals to cash out so that the SWIFT community
can better protect itself, through both cybersecurity controls and financial crime compliance processes.
Large scale cyber heists, in which cyber-attackers manage to steal significant amounts of money from <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY>,
continue to create news headlines. Various reports have been produced previously on how some of these
attacks, such as those against banks’ high-value payment systems, succeed and how organisations can
mount better defences. <ORG>BAE Systems</ORG> and <ORG>SWIFT</ORG> have jointly published reports on cyber heist techniques
used against financial institutions and the evolution of the cyber threat to the <INDUSTRY>banking</INDUSTRY> community in 2017¹ and
2019² respectively.
However, to date, there has not been significant material published on what happens to funds after they have
been stolen. This report focuses on that area, specifically the money laundering related activities necessary for
cyber-attackers to not only conduct and ‘cash out’ a successful attack but also avoid the money subsequently
being traced.
This report describes how money laundering is typically performed in the context of large-scale cyber heists.
It illustrates key parts of the typical processes used by cyber-criminals with examples to help better inform
readers on areas they should focus on to better prevent, detect and respond to money laundering. In addition,
the report offers perspectives on areas in which controls could be further improved and how money laundering
techniques may evolve.

2. Introduction
The activities of all cyber-criminals, whether working individually, as part of a small gang, as organised crime
groups, or even for a nation state, have resulted in annual total cyber-crime revenue estimated at USD1.5 trillion³.
<INDUSTRY>Banks</INDUSTRY> remain a prime target for cyber-criminals because they are critical infrastructure that can facilitate direct
access to cash/funds.
The <INDUSTRY>financial</INDUSTRY> industry, however, is not an easy target. <INDUSTRY>Banks</INDUSTRY>, law enforcement and industry bodies continue
to evolve cyber defences, improve information sharing, and regularly prevent money from ultimately being
stolen even when the first stage of a cyber-attack may have seemed successful. Cross industry efforts such as
SWIFT’s Customer Security Programme (CSP), which provides tools, information and a framework to help the
SWIFT community secure itself, and payments screening services continue to evolve to mitigate cyber-attacks.
For example, 91% of SWIFT customers, representing 99% of SWIFT traffic, attested to their compliance with
controls set out by the latest Customer Controls Security Framework, a set of security controls which serve as
the cornerstone of CSP. In addition, <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY> have improved response security controls such as the ability to stop or
recall fraudulent payment instructions where these are identified quickly enough.
However, the lure of targeting <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY> to get ready access to cash remains prevalent, and attackers continue
to develop their techniques. In recent years, many attacks have moved from targeting high-value payment
systems to targeting ATM networks and related systems. While these may, on the face of it, seem to have a
lower inherent value as any ATM inherently holds a limited amount of cash, in terms of successfully obtaining
multi-million dollar sums of money across a number of attacks, this has to date proved to be a successful
alternate route for attackers.
But irrespective of the cyber-attack method, the challenge all criminals face after a successful cyber-attack is
getting hold of cash or other liquid financial assets that are perceived as ‘clean’, i.e. where it is not possible to tell it
is from the proceeds of crime. This is where the need for money laundering comes in.
The money laundering and associated techniques described in this report are those considered relevant to
large-scale cyber heists against <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY>’ high-value payment systems and ATM related systems, including back-
office payment systems. Such cyber attacks involve being able to manipulate or subvert the correct operation
of high-value payment systems or management systems controlling a number of ATMs. This paper has not
specifically considered what happens to money stolen in other financial crime related attacks such as physical
attacks against individual ATMs, card skimming and cloning, banking Trojans and malware, authorised push
payment or business email compromise type attacks. However, the money laundering techniques and controls
described are likely to also be relevant in many of these cases.

3. Money Laundering Overview
In the strictest sense, money is laundered whenever a person or business deals in any way with another person
or organisation’s benefits from crime. Traditionally, money laundering has been described as a process which
takes place in three stages: placement, layering and integration:
• Placement – Criminally derived funds are introduced into the financial system in the case of an ATM style
attack, or, in the case of a cyber heist against a bank’s high value payment systems; placement covers the
initial fraudulent movement of funds
• Layering – Illicit funds are moved through the financial system in order to disguise their origin and
ownership. This is the most substantive phase of the process
• Integration – Laundered funds are re-introduced into the legitimate economy, or reinvested into the
criminal enterprise
Various methods underpin how funds are typically removed from a bank during a large-scale cyber-heist, as
well as the money laundering techniques that aim to conceal their subsequent movement. There can also be
significant overlap between the money laundering phases in reality.

The following sections describe each of these four money laundering related phases in more detail, covering:
• Preparatory activities
• Placement
• Layering
• Integration

3.1 Preparatory Activities
For large-scale cyber heists to be successfully executed, attackers need to perform a number of steps in advance.
Outside of those relevant to successfully conducting the cyber element of the heist, which are not the focus of
this paper, money laundering steps the attackers need to complete include:
• Setting up or gaining access to bank accounts into which stolen funds can be initially received, or in the case
of ATM-related heists, the attackers need to recruit and train money-mules to take the stolen cash out of
the ATMs
• Recruiting money-mules to transfer the stolen funds out of those accounts

baesystems.com/SWIFT 7 // 28
3.1.1 Account set up
• Setting up accounts to be used in a cyber-heist is a key step as these accounts will
be the destination of the funds after they have been stolen, also known as the
‘end-beneficiary’. There have been many instances where these accounts have
been set up in good faith, believing that the account holders are genuine and
of decent integrity, due to the use of false identification documents or by using
legitimate identification documents from individuals who have been coerced by
criminals to allow the account to be used. There have also been instances where
existing accounts were used – for example where an individual who no-longer
has a requirement for their valid account hands it over to someone else, rather
than closing it. The establishment of these fraudulent accounts, by whichever
method, might be facilitated by weak or ineffective policies and controls
linked to the customer due diligence processes and also by lack of training of
front-line staff.
• In order to avoid suspicion, fraudulent accounts might be set up several months
before the heist, and so are empty and unused. Assigning fake projects and
companies to these fraudulent accounts serves the purpose of giving credibility
as well as explaining why, at some point, they will be in receipt of large money
transfers. In line with this, as an additional obfuscation technique, accounts linked
to fake organisations may be set up to be used as a hub and collation point for
stolen funds after they have been transferred to the initial fraudulent accounts.
• The effectiveness of a financial institution’s Know Your Customer (KYC) and
screening processes are also important factors – and is likely why certain
institutions in certain jurisdictions are targeted for illicit activity. The ‘Know Your
Customer’ process is a vital part of validating users - from simple name screening
and undertaking background checks through to enhanced due diligence (EDD)
with independent assurance provided by two person validation to provide greater
level of scrutiny. If these processes are weak or ineffective, or if the staff is poorly
trained, then this allows these checks to be ineffective. Furthermore, there have
been cases where a complicit or coerced insider has helped to evade or reduce the
scrutiny of compliance teams carrying out KYC and due diligence checks of new
account openings.

8 // 28 Follow The Money
• For ATM cashouts, the nature of account set-up differs
depending on the type of method used.
• ATM FASTCash involves the fraudulent duplication
of legitimate cards, which requires cyber-criminals
to access customer records in order to create a
duplicate card.
• ATM cashouts involve an insider creating a phantom
transfer of funds to accounts that are owned by
recruited money-mules. In order to create a layer
of obfuscation, fake identities are used for these
accounts so that the mule’s identity is concealed.
• ATM management cashouts that involve a cyber-
intrusion which remotely controls ATMs do not require
accounts to be set up to carry-out the heist.
3.1.2 Recruit money-mules
• A common denominator that underpins cyber-heists is
the essential function of the money-mule – irrespective
of the diversity of the cyber-crime group, the execution
of the heist, or the final destination of laundered funds.
Their role seeks to provide the obfuscation in the chain
between the initial fraud in the <INDUSTRY>bank</INDUSTRY> and the transfer
of stolen funds to cyber-criminals. Accounts used for
money-muling may be created by those complicit in
the criminal activity or may belong to unsuspecting
individuals tricked into allowing their account to be used
for criminal purposes. These are the various actions that
would qualify as a money-mule supporting cyber-heists:
• Someone’s bank account being controlled and taken
over by a cyber-criminal / selling control to a cyber-
criminal.
• Receiving funds into a bank account before onward
transfer to a cyber-criminal.
• Using a fake identity to open an account for the sole
purpose of benefiting a cyber-criminal.
• Re-shipping items purchased by a cyber-criminal
using stolen banking details.
• Collecting stolen funds via ATM cash outs.

baesystems.com/SWIFT 9 // 28
• Cyber-criminals have become more creative with their methodologies for
recruiting money-mules. Some cyber-criminals often dupe innocent victims
into laundering money on their behalf with the promise of easy money by
using seemingly legitimate job adverts, online posts, social media and other
methods. This includes incorporating aspects like diversity and inclusion (D&I)
into job adverts to encourage a person to believe the company is real, as well
as creating fake management teams. Some job adverts appear to be targeted
towards people based in countries that are not typical financial targets, (e.g.
<GEO>UK</GEO>, <GEO>US</GEO>, and <GEO>Australia</GEO>). For cyber-criminals in <GEO>Eastern Europe</GEO> this recruitment
technique serves as further obfuscation, due to international transfers increasing
the complexity.
• Many money-mule recruitment efforts focus on individuals, especially young
adults including those seeking to fund higher education and adults recently out of
work, who are likely to jump at the chance to apparently easily earn extra cash.
Some examples of money-mule related job adverts are shown on the following
page, indicating that in many cases, the money-mules are not strongly linked
with the cyber-attackers.

10 // 28 Follow The Money
• Some cyber-criminals that are part of a large organised crime group are able to
draw upon a cadre of associates for money-muling purposes. For nation-state
cyber-groups which specialise in the ATM FASTCash technique, their links with
various criminal groups in <GEO>East Asia</GEO> are utilised in order to recruit money-mules to
travel to specific locations in order to withdraw cash from ATMs.

baesystems.com/SWIFT 11 // 28
3.2 Placement
Placement involves the initial movement of stolen funds into the financial system. This can be the initial account
into which stolen funds are transferred, or in the case of large-scale ATM based heists, the method of converting
the cash obtained in a local currency into a more transferable currency, such as USD$.
3.2.1 Use of Money-mules
Money-mules serve as intermediaries for cyber-
criminals and criminal organisations, where they act
as a bridge between the exfiltration of stolen funds
from a <INDUSTRY>bank</INDUSTRY> to transferring these funds to criminal
benefactors. In this way, the money-mule is the
essential first step in the placement of criminally
derived funds into the financial system.
The number of money-mules involved in
placement activities for a large-scale cyber-heist
varies but has often been seen to involve around 10
individuals. However, there are of course exceptions
to this. For example, an attack against one <INDUSTRY>bank</INDUSTRY>
which is considered to be linked to the <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus
Group</THREAT_ACTOR> involved 12,000 ATM withdrawals being
performed in approximately a two-hour timeframe
across 28 countries, pointing to a large and
organised group of money-mules being involved.
It should also be noted that other money-mules will
likely be used further along the money laundering
chain, with multiple sets of mules being used to
obfuscate the source of the stolen funds, and thus
their total number may be much higher than those
involved in the initial placement activity.

3.2.2 Risk of money muling
Despite being financially rewarded for their part in carrying-out a successful cyber-
heist, the intrinsic risk associated with a money-mule is significant. In the event of an
investigation by law enforcement and the authorities after a heist, the actions of the
money mule are at the front line of the heist. Issues during the money-mule stage have
led to the ultimate arrest of cyber-group leaders; however, it can often be the case that
money-mules are the scapegoats, punished for their involvement, whereas the rest of
the cyber group remain at large4.
The process of money-muling marks the most physical aspect of an ATM related
cyber heist, which is why it might be considered to be the weakest link in a cyber-
heist, as well as underlining the risk associated with money-muling at an ATM. CCTV
cameras that are often present at ATM locations offer the chance to identify and record
suspicious behaviour and capture facial features that could in some circumstances be
cross referenced with law enforcement or border control data. The methodologies that
underpin the various ATM cashout techniques carry certain risks. The lack of a card
and pin entry associated with the ATM management technique has been noticed as
suspicious by law enforcement, and has led to the arrest of money-mules. Similarly,
the speedy draining of cash from ATMs, which were targeted by a FASTCash theft was
identified as unusual by banking staff and led to the subsequent arrest of money-mules.
3.2.3 Money-muling interventions
Many initiatives that look to mitigate the risk of successful cyber-heists focus on money-mules. At the end
of 2019, law enforcement authorities from 31 countries, supported by <ORG>Europol</ORG>, <ORG>Eurojust</ORG> and the <ORG>European
Banking Federation</ORG> (<ORG>EBF</ORG>), came together to support the fifth coordinated global action against money
muling, with the European Money Mule Action5 . In the period between September and November 2019,
this resulted in the identification of 3833 money-mules alongside 386 money-mule recruiters, of which
228 were arrested. More than 650 <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY>, 17 <INDUSTRY>bank</INDUSTRY> associations and other financial institutions helped to
report 7520 fraudulent money-mule transactions, preventing a total loss of €12.9 million.

“The European Money Mule Action (EMMA) shows how a close public-
private partnership between law enforcement, judicial authorities and
the banking sector is essential to effectively tackle the illegal activity of
money muling.”
<ORG>Europol</ORG>-<ORG>Eurojust</ORG>-<ORG>European Banking Federation</ORG> (<ORG>EBF</ORG>)
3.3 Layering
Layering is the most substantive phase of the money laundering process, involving multiple steps to
conceal the origin and ownership of the stolen funds.
3.3.1 What happens after the funds are with the initial money-mule?
Monies withdrawn from ATMs in cyber-heists tend to be immediately exchanged into US Dollars
at money exchanges. This step in the process could suggest complicity by employees at money
exchanges to support a money laundering process, albeit via a bribe, or it could indicate negligence.
Although in some cases the initial money-mules have been caught, in others where the heist has
been successful, e.g. after the money-mule has withdrawn funds from an ATM, they might be
passed onto an intermediary who, in turn, passes the stolen funds to the cyber-criminal. However,
in some instances, especially after cyber-heists relating to nation state actors like the <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus
Group</THREAT_ACTOR>, it might be the case that the fate of these stolen funds is to be channelled via other layering
techniques in order to further obfuscate the path of the stolen funds.
Out of all attempted <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus</THREAT_ACTOR> heists, a subset showed successful fraudulent transactions with a
majority of transfers being sent to <GEO>East Asia</GEO>, where there are numerous linked front companies.

16 // 28 Follow The Money
3.3.2 Obfuscation of funds via front companies
The setting up of front companies can be used by some jurisdictions as a method to
circumvent the adverse impact of imposed sanctions and to enable covert access to
the global financial system. It also facilitates the potential for obfuscating the flow of
money and concealing various techniques for money laundering. Front companies
are corporations that act as a ‘cover’ for the laundering of illicit funds and typically lack
significant legitimate assets. They either do not maintain active business operations, or,
in some instances, the front company can have a legitimate purpose, which is used as
an effective way of concealing the true ownership of businesses and accounts, as well
as associated assets and parties. In this way, front companies can be an effective entity
through which illicit transactions can be circulated and consequently obfuscated. Front
companies are often set up in jurisdictions that are known for strong banking secrecy
laws or for poor enforcement of money laundering regulations, as these are preferable
for individuals with illicit intentions.
3.3.3 Cash businesses
Cash intense businesses can refer to high end luxury goods markets, such as the <INDUSTRY>gold
market</INDUSTRY>, and the <INDUSTRY>diamond</INDUSTRY> and <INDUSTRY>jewels</INDUSTRY> industries as well as more generic businesses like
<INDUSTRY>betting shops</INDUSTRY>, <INDUSTRY>casino</INDUSTRY>s, or other services. As these industries transact mainly in cash, they
can offer a mechanism for laundering the proceeds of a crime. <INDUSTRY>Casino</INDUSTRY>s are significant
cash businesses and can be used by a launderer to clean cash by converting it into chips
at a casino, and then exchange it back into cash to deposit at a bank, and have a cheque
from the casino showing a legitimate transaction. The fact that in some jurisdictions
names are unregistered and winnings unreported have made casinos an attractive
method for laundering stolen funds.

baesystems.com/SWIFT 17 // 28
3.3.4 Use of financial representatives
Front companies registered in <GEO>East Asia</GEO> are considered to operate on behalf of the
government of a <ORG>FATF</ORG> high risk jurisdiction. In one instance, a front company was
accused of laundering more than USD$100 million for the sanctioned state-run bank
of a <ORG>FATF</ORG> high risk jurisdiction. Financial representatives using East Asian aliases,
or in close liaison with facilitators in <GEO>East Asia</GEO>, are responsible for setting up and
operating front companies and bank accounts across the <GEO>East Asia</GEO> region. These
front companies and relationships offer a method of laundering the proceeds from a
cyber-heist in order to expedite and obfuscate the process of stolen funds being used
for nefarious purposes, such as purchasing equipment to bypass sanctions. In one
example front companies import natural resources without making any prepayment.
These organisations resell the natural resource to customers across <GEO>Asia</GEO>, retaining the
<GEO>US</GEO> Dollar proceeds. Rather than sending funds to the <ORG>FATF</ORG> high risk jurisdiction, the
following obfuscation stages occur:
• The payments received by this organisation from customers are processed via banks
in <GEO>East Asia</GEO> and diced up into smaller outflows (minus a fee for facilitating the sale).
This forms part of an intricate layering scheme directed to front companies and
<INDUSTRY>shipping</INDUSTRY> or trade businesses typically registered in jurisdictions in <GEO>East Asia</GEO>. Financial
representatives are key to establishing the front companies and making the transactions
appear legitimate.
• The <ORG>FATF</ORG> high risk jurisdiction sends instructions to the front company of items it would like
to purchase. The front companies then use the received payments to purchase and ship
commodities. Items purchased can range from bulk commodities, luxury items, electronic
items as well as equipment. It is assessed that items used could be smuggled with other
non-suspicious shipments.

18 // 28 Follow The Money
3.3.5 Red flags
Red flags relating to front companies that are involved in illicit financial activity are:
• Financial activity by a front company that has no relevance to its stated area of business
• Evidence of shared entities between front companies, including addresses, phones
numbers, managers and owners
• Front companies that lack obvious public activity or presence
• Business types cited for front companies involved in illicit activity are often <INDUSTRY>textile</INDUSTRY>,
<INDUSTRY>garment</INDUSTRY>, <INDUSTRY>fishery</INDUSTRY>, and <INDUSTRY>seafood</INDUSTRY> businesses.
These red flags could assist individuals in financial institutions working on areas of compliance
like due diligence and KYC screening to better detect front companies used for illicit purposes.
3.3.6 Facilitating jurisdictions
Regulations and conditions that govern company registration and reporting
requirements in <GEO>East Asia</GEO> make the region an attractive place to do business, as well
as vulnerable to being abused. In some of the region’s jurisdictions, a company’s
registered office must be there and it is permitted to share an office with their
company secretary, but neither technically has to operate out of that address. This
loophole, which would typically be considered as a red flag for money laundering
investigators, underpins how nefarious activity is facilitated, since it has enabled the
creation of vast numbers of front companies. This explains why this hub has been
attractive for heavily sanctioned jurisdictions seeking to access international trading
markets and to facilitate money laundering.
<GEO>East Asia</GEO> can also serve as an effective gateway that offers sanctioned jurisdictions
access to US Dollars, via clearing services offered from some jurisdictions, potentially
providing a route that might enable oversight for payments between banks using
US Dollars to be circumvented.
“The East Asian international financial hub has company formation and
3.3.7 Financial transaction recipients
registration rules that we think need to be stronger…It is important it has
mechanisms and regulations prohibiting activities that facilitate financial
transactions with a <ORG>FATF</ORG> high risk jurisdiction.”

3.4 Integration
The means and methods by which cyber-criminals choose to convert stolen funds into an usable end product or
asset can be a useful barometer of the strategic professionalism and experience of the cyber-attack group. It can
also help the process through which law enforcement agencies might close in on the group.
3.4.1 Cash-out conundrum
The cash out process opted for by cyber-criminals (including those involved in precursor
steps, money-mules, operating front companies, etc.) can reveal a strong correlation
between the extravagant ways stolen funds are spent, and the professionalism of the
criminal. Operations that were early in a cyber-criminal’s history or were a one-off
occurrence reveal an immediacy in how stolen funds are used – be it to clear a pressing
debt or for materialistic acquisition. Such suspicious behaviour could be the first clue in
linking them to the heist, which could ultimately start a trail that leads to members of
the cyber-group being identified.

20 // 28 Follow The Money
3.4.2 Integration of funds: cyber-criminals
Some cyber-attack groups have been seen to make many extravagant purchases,
possibly borne out of inexperience, as it draws the attention of law enforcement agencies
and often leads to the arrest of the cyber-criminals. An inability to use the funds more
strategically with less ostentatious purchases is often their undoing. In other cases, the
methods chosen to cash-out the proceeds of a cyber-heist illustrate greater experience
and a strategic approach driven by wanting to maintain a low profile. <INDUSTRY>Property</INDUSTRY> and
<INDUSTRY>jewellery</INDUSTRY> are investments that are likely to hold their value and potentially less likely to
attract the attention of law enforcement.
3.4.3 Integration of funds: nation state actors
The independence and freedoms enjoyed by criminal cyber-groups are not shared by
nation state cyber-groups. Far from their actions leading to materialistic acquisition and
personal possessions, the purpose of these cyber actors is to fulfil the demands and
wishes of the regime.
3.4.4 Reinvesting in criminality
As a final stage of money laundering, cyber-criminals might seek to integrate the
proceeds of a cyber-heist by reinvesting in crime, especially in the illegal drugs market.
Over a third of organised crime groups in <GEO>Europe</GEO>, including cyber-criminals, are
directly involved in the production or trafficking of illegal drugs. Cyber-criminals have
been known to operate websites, which facilitate the sale of illegal drugs, firearms,
malicious software, hacking tools, stolen financial information, payment cards and other
illegal counterfeit goods on a number of dark web marketplaces. In some instances,
this activity can lead to kickback payments in bitcoin that is equivalent to several
million USD$.
3.4.5 Cryptocurrency and its growing appeal
Identified cases of laundering through cryptocurrencies remain relatively small
compared to the volumes of cash laundered through traditional methods. However,
in one major case, a significant cyber-crime group is estimated to have converted
stolen funds obtained from ATM cashouts into cryptocurrency. The raft of alternative
cryptocurrencies that offer greater anonymity, as well as services like mixers and
tumblers that help obscure the source of funds by blending potentially identifiable
cryptocurrency funds with large amounts of other funds, could boost the appeal of
cryptocurrency for nefarious purposes.

In one case that resulted in arrest and prosecution, authorities found 15,000
bitcoins valued at USD$109 million, two sports cars and jewellery worth
USD$557,000 at the house of the group leader. The group was found to operate
in a truly international manner: the bitcoin farm where the group mined bitcoin
in order to launder the stolen funds from the heists was located in an industrial
building in East Asia, while many of the group arrested originated from Eastern
Europe and the leader enjoyed the benefits of the stolen funds in Western Europe.
For heavily sanctioned territories, like a <ORG>FATF</ORG> high risk jurisdiction whose modus
operandi focusses on raising funds with minimal associated risk, cryptocurrency
offers a different income stream to targeting <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY> and <INDUSTRY>financial</INDUSTRY> institutions. It
has been shown how the <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus Group</THREAT_ACTOR> have harnessed East Asian facilitators7
in order to launder funds after a heist at a cryptocurrency exchange, using
techniques that are similar to that described for heists from <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY>. The following
summarises the process from the point of execution of the cyber heist:
• <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus Group</THREAT_ACTOR> steal funds in cryptocurrency from an exchange and stolen
cryptocurrency is sent to multiple exchanges as a layering technique.
• East Asian facilitators, working on behalf of the <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus Group</THREAT_ACTOR> and the
regime, receive a portion of the stolen funds.
• The East Asian facilitators transfer the cryptocurrency across addresses they
hold, in order to further obfuscate the origin of the funds.
• East Asian facilitators move a portion of the received funds through newly
added bank accounts that are linked to their exchange account – this enables
the conversion from cryptocurrency into fiat currency. Other stolen funds
might be transferred in Bitcoin into prepaid gift cards, which can be used at
other exchanges to purchase additional Bitcoin.
Further insight into the money laundering methods used by the <THREAT_ACTOR>Lazarus Group</THREAT_ACTOR>
is offered by activity after a cyber-theft at a cryptocurrency exchange in June
20188. This resulted in the theft of USD$30 million in various crypto-assets.
Subsequently, almost 2,000 Bitcoin was moved into a cryptocurrency exchange
in Eastern Europe, over a 4 day period, involving 68 transactions. It is assessed
that such a painstaking, strategic pattern of transactions is consistent with a desire
to circumvent an exchange’s anti money-laundering (AML) controls, including red
flags associated with transaction limits.

3.4.6 Prepaid cryptocurrency cards
Cyber-criminals might seek to use cryptocurrency as a method for obfuscating and
laundering the funds stolen during a cyber-heist, before making various purchases in
order to integrate the funds. In this instance, cyber-criminals might launder the stolen
funds at a bitcoin farm, before using financial platforms to load prepaid cards with
bitcoin. Prepaid cryptocurrency cards can facilitate the reversion of cryptocurrency
back into fiat currency in small amounts. This technique is enabled by a loophole
so when the original financial institution issues the card, it does so in conjunction
with the card issuer’s partner – this partner company receive and convert the funds
from cryptocurrency into fiat currency. The stolen money from several cyber-heists
has in some cases been seen to be laundered via cryptocurrencies, using prepaid
cards that are linked to cryptocurrency wallets. Financial platforms in <GEO>Europe</GEO> and
the <GEO>UK</GEO> have been used to load prepaid cards with bitcoin, which were subsequently
used to purchase jewellery, cars and property with stolen funds – those assets may
sometimes then be subsequently sold, as a further money laundering step.
3.4.7 Converting cryptocurrency into tangible assets
An emergence of online marketplaces could offer effective methods for converting
cryptocurrencies into tangible assets that can be held anonymously, or be sold as
an extra step of laundering the proceeds of a cyber-heist. There are dedicated sites
that facilitate the purchase of high-end land and property assets across the world,
including luxury penthouses and tropical islands, as well as <INDUSTRY>watches</INDUSTRY>, <INDUSTRY>jewellery</INDUSTRY>,
<INDUSTRY>gold bars</INDUSTRY>, and <INDUSTRY>fine</INDUSTRY> art. The concern for the financial system is that these digital
transactions are conducted in a peer-to-peer manner that circumvents the checks and
processes by <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY>, and often require only an e-mail address to make the purchase.
This means that funds used to make a purchase that have been acquired by criminal
means can be kept concealed.

4. Mitigation of money laundering risks
4.1 Information sharing technologies
A central initiative in empowering <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY> to be better able to detect illicit activity refers to them
having more visibility of a greater pool of data. This is not only with regards to enhancing
public-private sharing initiatives that foster better timely exchanges between financial
institutions and law enforcement agencies, but also between financial institutions. In 2017,
SWIFT created a global information sharing initiative, establishing a dedicated Customer
Security Intelligence (CSI) team to investigate cyber incidents experienced by its customers and
introduced a ‘SWIFT ISAC’ information sharing portal to share threat intelligence across the
SWIFT member community.
Without amendments to legal and regulatory frameworks to enable <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY> to embrace
advances in technology and data science to facilitate the safe sharing of AML information,
identifying illicit behaviour will remain in their blind-spot until it’s too late. The development of
public-private partnerships to aid in the sharing of information between financial institutions
and law enforcement has been mainly successful. There are also many technologies for
enhancing information sharing between <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY>, including harnessing machine learning to
enrich and make transaction and account monitoring programs more powerful and efficient.
One approach that has been investigated by several <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY> is the use of Privacy Enhancing
Technology, including homomorphic encryption, as a method of allowing queries to be run
by one organisation on encrypted or open data sets held by other organisations in a privacy-
enhancing manner to protect the nature of the queries being made.
4.2 Augmented sharing of risk factors pertaining to <ORG>FATF</ORG> high risk jurisdiction
A <ORG>FATF</ORG> high risk jurisdiction which conducts illicit practises via front companies in East Asia, in
order to evade sanctions and launder monies, has been the subject of thorough investigations.
However, there is a need to distil and cascade the key findings from such investigations across
the international financial system. This will enable institutions to be more agile in identifying
transactions that might relate to nefarious activity linked to a <ORG>FATF</ORG> high risk jurisdiction and trigger
the need for enhanced due diligence. These refer to the presence of front companies in <GEO>East Asia</GEO>
and the associated red flags that should alert suspicion. And given the activity of some diplomats
from a <ORG>FATF</ORG> high risk jurisdiction to use accounts in the names of family members to evade
sanctions and assist money laundering practises, these names could be shared with financial
institutions to screen against as part of KYC and enhanced due diligence processes, as long as it is
permitted by data protection and legal frameworks in various jurisdictions.
Similarly, augmented sharing of the red flags / situational circumstances that led to the
successful arrest of individuals involved in the laundering stages of a cyber-heist could greatly
increase awareness and agility in financial institutions and law enforcement agencies across
various jurisdictions, which could ultimately lead to a reduction in vulnerabilities. Standard setting
organisations, as well as regional <ORG>Fraud Intelligence Units</ORG>, could be effective conduits for such risk
mitigating information sharing.

4.3 Money-Mule initiatives
The essential role of the money-mule in facilitating successful cyber-heists
and enabling criminals to separate themselves from the fraud and the
money laundering stages makes it an obvious focus area for risk mitigating
initiatives. Numerous government, policing and industry initiatives have
been launched, including:
• A series of coordinated actions by <ORG>Europol’s Cybercrime Centre</ORG> (<ORG>EC3</ORG>),
<ORG>the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce</ORG> (<ORG>J</ORG>-CAT), <ORG>Eurojust</ORG>, and the
<ORG>European Banking Federation</ORG> have supported the <ORG>European Money-
mule Action initiative</ORG>.
• <ORG>Cifas</ORG>, the <GEO>UK</GEO>’s fraud prevention service have launched a joint
campaign with <ORG>Financial Fraud Action UK</ORG> (<ORG>FFA</ORG> <GEO>UK</GEO>), which fights
financial fraud for the <GEO>UK</GEO> payments industry, called the Don’t Be
Fooled campaign. This aims to deter young people – in particular
students – from becoming money-mules.
• In December 2019, the <ORG>U.S. DOJ</ORG> and federal, state and international
law enforcement partners announced a concentrated effort across
the country and around the world to halt money-mule activity and
shut down the enterprises that exploit the most vulnerable in society.
The initiative aims to end the conduct of money-mules, as well as
execute search warrants to secure evidence from money-mules who
knowingly aided and abetted fraud schemes.
The success of funds-in-flight monitoring systems such as the Mule
Insights Tactical Solution9, that looks to augment the tracing of funds
that are moved through the financial system, as well as initiatives like the
European Money Mule Action that aims to identify and arrest mules, as
well as engage with those most vulnerable to becoming a mule will be
vital in preventing and deterring their viability. However, these initiatives
will not address the risk posed by the rogue insider, who opens a bank
account for the benefit of a cyber-criminal using a fake identity. This risk
remains and is dependent on local regulators ensuring standards are
maintained across financial institutions, as well as individual financial
institutions regularly checking the integrity of employees’ work and
preventing accounts being set-up that are able to evade proper KYC
processes and due-diligence screening.

4.4 Compliance and reporting enhancements
There has been a tendency for cyber-heists to occur in jurisdictions where regulations are
weaker, and there is a requirement for global standard setting bodies to do more in removing
the platform for potential corruption. It is encouraging that some regulators in <GEO>East Asia</GEO>
have set up a Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce in order to enhance the
detection, prevention and disruption of money laundering. Other necessary requirements
include tightening customer due diligence measures across financial institutions, to include
the identification and verification of customers and the beneficial owner, as well as clarifying
the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship. Enhancing reporting channels
so that institutions can register their suspicions of illicit activity to a trusted and competent
authority might also help to visualise networks of obfuscation and money laundering and
identify criminal activity.
4.5 Insufficient cyber security
A pervasive issue across financial institutions is a reliance on legacy systems
and processes. Often they have been spliced together through mergers,
leaving them vulnerable to cyber-threat actors. Some cyber-security experts
believe some <INDUSTRY>banks</INDUSTRY> are not investing smartly in maintaining systems and
processes. Instead, they tend to focus on costly, complex, perimeter and
device endpoint solutions, rather than focusing on investing in data centric
security around main business assets and detecting abuse and intrusion
by looking at the data and application layer. Financial institutions will
continue to be vulnerable if they fail to identify and remediate network and
application vulnerabilities before criminals have a chance to exploit them.
Similarly, regular and updated staff awareness courses that help employees
understand and spot risks relating to spear-phishing are simple initiatives that
could pay dividends. For their part, augmented communication by regulators
of usable cyber threat information that addresses security incident reports
and systemic deficiencies could bolster cyber-security awareness across the
financial sector.
“For too long, cybercriminals have exploited an international divergence
in policy and legislation. I think we’re now starting to see people coming
together and understanding how to pool investigations together.”
Head of <ORG>Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre</ORG>

5. Conclusion
Large-scale cyber heist attempts are expected to continue and to evolve – the attackers are focused on going
after large-scale payouts and will continue to mount attacks to achieve their aims. In addition, the desire to
disrupt and destabilise the financial system, as opposed to just stealing funds should not be overlooked as an
ongoing risk. Whereas many financial institutions are likely to be able to recover from just a financial theft, the
distraction and destructive components of some techniques deployed by cyber-actors during a cyber heist are
likely to have far greater operational impact. This can cost more to correct, as well as lead to a prolonged period
of downtime for the financial institution, significantly impacting their customers and the institution’s reputation.
Many cyber heists will continue to be detected and stopped, especially as financial institutions continue to
improve their controls. However, financial institutions also need to ensure they don’t become complacent. Threat
actors have shown they will persist to seek to find ways around controls, including collaborating between groups
where combining their skills will provide the desired reward for each threat actor.
Ultimately, some large-scale cyber heist attacks will unfortunately continue to be successful. Therefore, as
money laundering is essential to a threat group realising the benefits of a successful large-scale cyber heist, a
focus on seeking to disrupt criminal activity throughout the money laundering process should continue.
Threat groups will continue to collaborate throughout the money laundering lifecycle, leveraging the global
criminal skillsets available and the willingness of many people to be tempted by the lure of an apparent quick
and easy payday. Particular focus therefore should apply to the money-muling activities and also to the
use of front companies. Collaboration will be key in these areas, both inter-organisational, within jurisdictions
and internationally. In addition, awareness of new money laundering techniques, such as those involving
cryptocurrency, will be key to staying ahead of the challenge of reducing the opportunities for threat groups to
benefit from committing high-value cyber heists.
